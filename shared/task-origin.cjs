/**
 * Whose idea was this task — somebody else's, or Nick's own?
 *
 * ── Why this exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The weekly risk report going to Chris counts "open" and "overdue" over the
 * whole task list, and that conflates two populations with nothing in common
 * but a due date:
 *
 *   • A COMMITMENT is work somebody else is expecting. It was asked for, or it
 *     was agreed in front of people who are now waiting on it. Missing one is a
 *     fact about Nick's reliability to other people, and it is exactly what
 *     competencies 3 and 4 are measured on.
 *
 *   • A CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT task is one Nick set himself — a system to build,
 *     a process to tighten, a report to automate. Nobody is waiting. It slipping
 *     is a fact about his own ambition, not about a broken promise.
 *
 * Counting them together makes the improvement backlog *penalise* him: a man who
 * writes down thirty ideas for making the department better and dates them
 * optimistically reads, in a compliance report, exactly like a man who has
 * broken thirty promises. That is the wrong way round, and it is why overdue in
 * the report now counts COMMITMENTS ONLY (Nick, 1 Sep 2026).
 *
 * ── There is deliberately NO default ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `shared/task-domain.cjs` defaults unknown to `work`, and argues for it: the
 * two mistakes there are asymmetric, and one of them is visible. Here they are
 * asymmetric in OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS, and both are expensive:
 *
 *   • An improvement task counted as a COMMITMENT inflates the overdue figure in
 *     a report read by the person assessing a PIP. It manufactures broken
 *     promises out of Nick's own stretch goals.
 *   • A commitment counted as IMPROVEMENT hides a real broken promise from that
 *     same report — the worse failure, because the report's whole job is to
 *     surface those, and it would be quietly telling the assessor everything is
 *     fine.
 *
 * There is no safe way to guess, so `null` is a first-class value and the report
 * counts it as its OWN bucket, named and never folded into either. "I have not
 * classified these yet" is a different sentence from "these are mine" and from
 * "these are promises", and the report says which one it means.
 *
 * ── Proposed vs decided ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `inferOrigin()` reads provenance the store already holds and proposes an
 * answer where the evidence is real. A proposal is stamped `origin_proposed`,
 * exactly as the 12 Aug MoSCoW import was: importing a guess as a decision
 * invents calls Nick never made. Setting it by hand is the decision, and the
 * flag comes off.
 *
 * Pure, browser-safe, no DB and no network — TodoPanel and saim/app both render
 * the badge, and three copies of a vocabulary is how six hardcoded rosters
 * drifted apart before it.
