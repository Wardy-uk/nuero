 * heading and `parseVaultTodos` reads it back onto the task as `msPlan`.
 *
 * Pure, and in `shared/` rather than in either frontend, because three surfaces
 * render task cards (NEURO's TodoPanel, SAiM's Tasks and Focus) and three copies
 * of "how do we word this" is how they come to disagree about the same task.
 *
 * UNKNOWN IS SILENCE, NEVER A GUESS. A plan that could not be read is null all
 * the way from Graph to here, and a card says nothing rather than naming a board
 * the task might not be on.

// ── Recurrence ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A recurring Microsoft To Do task does NOT disappear when you complete it.
// Graph accepts the PATCH, closes that occurrence, rolls the SAME task id
// forward to the next one and sets `status` back to `notStarted` — so the next
// mirror sync reads it from Graph as open and writes it straight back into
// `Tasks/Microsoft Tasks.md`.
//
// From Nick's side that is indistinguishable from a completion NEURO lost:
// tick it, and an hour later it is back. Three of his To Do tasks are monthly
// and months in arrears, so each tick advances them by exactly one occurrence
// and they reappear until the due date catches up with today. Ticked three
// times, back three times, with nothing anywhere saying why.
//
// So recurrence is READ from Graph, carried onto the mirror line and rendered.
// The point is not to change what happens — the roll is correct behaviour — but
// to make it legible, which is the difference between a system that lost your
// work and one that told you what it did with it.
//
// UNKNOWN IS "REPEATS", NEVER A GUESSED FREQUENCY. A pattern type this does not
// recognise still means the task comes back, and saying so is true; naming it
// "Monthly" because most of his are would be inventing a fact about his diary.
