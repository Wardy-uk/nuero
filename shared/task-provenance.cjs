/**
 * How a task got here, and when — in words Nick can act on.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A task card said what the task WAS and never how it arrived. Live example
 * (#251, 7 Sep 2026): "Review what happened and explain where the process broke
 * down" — MUST, high priority, due today, and Nick's own reaction was "I've no
 * idea what it is". Everything needed to answer that was already in the row
 * (`source`, `origin_path`, `created_at`) and no surface rendered any of it.
 *
 * A task you cannot trace is one you can only do two things with: work it
 * blindly, or delete it. Both are wrong when the thing was a real commitment.
 *
 * ── Rules ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. **PURE.** No DB, no vault, no network, no clock — `now` is passed. It runs
 *    per row on a list render and pins without a database. `.cjs` in `shared/`
 *    because BOTH frontends render task cards, and two copies of this
 *    vocabulary is how the desktop and the phone come to name one task's origin
 *    two different ways (the `shared/task-domain.cjs` rule).
 *
 * 2. **AN OPAQUE ID IS NEVER A LABEL.** `email:AAMkAGI1MjNl…` identifies the
 *    email to Microsoft Graph and to nobody else. Where the sender was not
 *    recorded this says so — "An email — sender not recorded" is a fact he can
 *    act on; 150 characters of base64 is not. The raw value still travels as
 *    `ref` for matching a row back to its source, but it is never the label.
 *    Same rule, same words, as `candidate-provenance` — which now shares these
 *    primitives rather than keeping a second copy.
 *
 * 3. **AN UNKNOWN SOURCE IS NAMED AS ITSELF, NEVER GUESSED.** A writer this
 *    module has not been taught renders as `Recorded as "<source>"`, which is
 *    true and greppable. Inventing a friendly sentence for an unrecognised
 *    value is how a card comes to assert a provenance nothing recorded.
 *
 * 4. **ONLY `manual` MAY SAY A PERSON TYPED IT.** `unattributed` is the
 *    positive gap value `createTask` stores when a writer forgot to name
 *    itself; it must read as a gap, because the whole reason that value exists
 *    is that `'manual'` used to be a claim rather than a fact.
 *
 * 5. **A MISSING DATE IS "not recorded", NEVER TODAY.** `created_at` has a
 *    default, so absence means something odd happened; rendering it as now
 *    would make the newest-looking task on the screen the one we know least
 *    about.
