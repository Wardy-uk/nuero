// `Now` — the execution surface, and the desktop's default view.

// This was the ADHD "Today" dashboard, sitting four clicks deep under MORE. It
// is promoted rather than rebuilt because it already owns every control that
// lowers the barrier to STARTING — the session container, the return prompt,
// "make it smaller", quick wins — and a thin new screen composing them would
// have been a second "what should I do?" surface, which is the one thing this
// phase exists to remove.
//
// ⚠ One thing changed rather than being added: "Right now" no longer renders
// `decision-engine` output straight out of `/api/adhd`. It renders the
// CANONICAL attention card, so acknowledging something here means what it means
// on the phone, and the five actions mean exactly what they say.
//
// The order on the page is the argument. Session and return prompt come FIRST,
// above any general suggestion: the cost of an interruption is not the
// interruption, it is the failure to return, and a page that opens with fresh
// work stacked on top of an unfinished thing is how the thread gets lost.
//
// The layout is the argument. One thing at the top, big, with a button. Evidence
// of progress immediately under it — ADHD memory drops finished work, so the day
// feels empty even when it wasn't. Avoidance is stated as fact and kept small.
// Quick wins sit at the bottom as the way back in when the top thing is too big.
//
// All the judgement is in services/adhd-dashboard.js. This file only renders.

/**
 * Getting going — starts, triage and the shrink ladders.
 *
 * All the judgement is server-side in `services/initiation-signals.js`; this
 * renders what it decided and adds nothing of its own. Three rules survive into
 * the markup and are worth not undoing:
 *
 *  - A shrink is stated as a fact about the WORK ("cut down to"), never as a
 *    count against Nick. No "you struggled with", no warning colour.
 *  - A capped count says so. `complete: false` means the history cap may have
 *    eaten part of the window, so the number is a floor.
 *  - Nothing renders at all on a day with no evidence and no gaps. An empty
 *    block that says "0 started" first thing in the morning is a reproach for
 *    not having begun a day that has barely started.

        Below the wins, deliberately. This card is honest and it matters, but
        it was sharing a grid row with Momentum — reward and reproach at equal
        weight in one eyeline. It reads completely differently once the day has
        already been credited above it.

                    pushing away, with nothing on it, is the single most
                    demoralising shape this page can take: it can only be read,
                    and it says the same thing again tomorrow.

                    What is offered depends on what the row actually knows.
