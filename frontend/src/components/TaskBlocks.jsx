 *
 * `BlockTimeControl` sits inside TaskControls — the row that is already open
 * when Nick is deciding what to do with a task. "Block an hour for this" is a
 * thought you have while looking AT the task, and a scheduling screen you have
 * to go and find is one that never gets found (the same call TaskDedupe made).
 *
 * `TaskBlocks` is the outstanding-write-ups list, mounted in TodoPanel beside
 * TaskDedupe. It is empty most days and that is the correct answer, not a broken
 * check — it only fills when a block has passed with nothing written about it.
 *
 * The card always says the block is HOLDING the task, never just that a note is
 * missing. A hold Nick cannot see the cause of is a task that mysteriously
 * refuses to complete, which is worse than no hold at all.
