/**
 * One canonical attention card, with the exact action semantics.
 *
 * Every surface that renders work — Now, Focus, Briefing — renders THIS, so the
 * five buttons cannot come to mean five different things in three places. The
 * wording, the destination and the permitted action set all come off the
 * record; nothing here reranks, rephrases or decides urgency.
 *
 * ── The semantics, each one a bug that has actually happened ────────────────
 *
 * **Open context** navigates, and calls NOTHING. This is the one that was
 * wrong: Briefing's "Do it" POSTed `/api/focus/action-done`, which logs an
 * outcome and dismisses the item — so opening a thing recorded it as finished
 * before any work had been done.
 *
 * **Start this** starts a focus session and leaves the record exactly where it
 * was. Picking something up is not finishing it. The record is told (`start`)
 * only so the friction read has the evidence; no state moves.
 *
 * **Done** is Nick saying so, and is the ONLY path that resolves. It closes the
 * underlying task where one can be found, and SAYS which of the two happened —
 * a tick held by the outcome-note rule must not read as a completion.
 *
 * **Not now** / **Waiting on someone** defer with the reason recorded, because
 * a thing put off three times because it needs context is a different problem
 * from one put off three times as not-now, and the friction read is built on
 * knowing which.
 *
 * **Not relevant** dismisses: it teaches suppression and touches no work.
 *
 * **Seen it** acknowledges: the card STAYS on screen and stops notifying, which
 * is the one distinction the old suppression timer could not express. It is on
 * the record's action set and the phone has always rendered it; the desktop
 * silently dropped it, so on a card that cannot be dismissed (an imminent
 * meeting, an escalation) there was no way to say "yes, I know" at all.
 *
 * Nothing here auto-completes, auto-defers, auto-dismisses, auto-starts or
 * sends anything on Nick's behalf. Every one of these is a click.
