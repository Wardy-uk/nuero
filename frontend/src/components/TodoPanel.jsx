// ── Editing controls ──
// Only shown for tasks NEURO owns (task_id present). Before the 13 Aug migration none
// of MoSCoW / priority / due date could be edited anywhere: the metadata lived in a
// worksheet file. Now it is a plain DB write and the vault export follows.
/**
 * A card's edits are a DRAFT until Save.
 *
 * ── Why ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every control here used to PATCH on click. Each patch refetched and re-ranked
 * the list, so setting a MoSCoW moved the card out from under the cursor before
 * the priority beside it had been touched — triaging one task meant chasing it
 * up the screen through four separate re-sorts. Worse, none of these buttons
 * stopped their click bubbling to the row's expand handler, so every one of
 * them ALSO collapsed the card it lived on.
 *
 * Triage is one thought, not five. It writes once now, on a deliberate Save.
 *
 * ⚠ The draft resets on the row's IDENTITY, never on its values. The panel
 * refetches on a timer and after every write elsewhere on the screen, so an
 * effect keyed on `todo.moscow` and friends would wipe half-finished edits
 * whenever a background poll landed — silently, and indistinguishably from a
 * button that never registered.
 *
 * BlockTimeControl and HouseholdToggle are deliberately NOT drafted. They are
 * not fields, they are actions with consequences of their own (a real calendar
 * event; a task published to VESTA, which Nick's partner reads on a public
 * URL), each already gated by its own confirmation. Parking those behind a
 * shared Save would make one button whose blast radius ranges from "changed a
 * letter" to "put this on the internet".
 */
/**
 * Pick this task up NOW.
 *
 * The task list had no way to start a focus session on anything — three
 * surfaces could start one (the Now card, quick wins, TimeFitCard) and none of
 * them was the screen where Nick actually browses his work. So starting meant
 * going to Now and hoping the thing he wanted was the card it had chosen.
 *
 * ⚠ It navigates NOWHERE and needs no `onNavigate`. The session is server-side
 * state and `SessionBadge` renders it in the topbar on every page, so starting
 * from here shows up immediately without yanking him off the list he is working
 * through — which would undo the point of being able to start from it.
 *
 * A session already running comes back 409 with that session attached, which is
 * a QUESTION rather than an error: it names what he is on and offers the swap,
 * exactly as AdhdPanel does. Choosing not to swap must leave both alone.

 * the moment a due date is set, that row jumps up the ordering, every index
 * below it shifts by one, and a key built from `id` names a DIFFERENT task.
 *
 * That is what made the due date impossible to edit: pick a date, the list
 * re-sorts, and the expanded row silently collapses or a neighbour opens
 * instead — indistinguishable from the control not working. It applied to every
 * control on the row; the date one just happens to be the one that moves the
 * row it lives on.
 *
 * `task_id` is the real identity for anything NEURO owns. A file-backed mirror
 * has none, so it falls back to where the line lives, and only then to the
 * positional id — which is still unstable, but is the best a row with no
 * identity of its own can offer.

 * wrong answer when the thing was a real commitment somebody is waiting on.
 *
 * WARNING: rendered only for rows NEURO OWNS. A Microsoft mirror has no NEURO
 * created_at and its source is the board - which the plan badge above already
 * says - so a line here would read "Added - date not recorded - Recorded as
 * 'MS Planner'" on every one of them: a label every row shares, which sorts
 * nothing and is the finding that made a MUST on every task useless.
 *
 * WARNING: the wording is NEVER built here. `shared/task-provenance.cjs` owns
 * it, so this panel, the phone and the Actions queue cannot name one task's
 * origin three different ways.
