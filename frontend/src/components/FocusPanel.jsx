/**
 * Focus — the one-at-a-time deck.
 *
 * A SUPPORTING view now: `Now` is the execution surface and the default screen,
 * and this is the place to page through the pool one card at a time when the
 * top of it is not the thing you want.
 *
 * ── What changed, and why each was wrong ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **"Done" POSTed `/api/focus/action-done`.** That logs an outcome through
 * `nextActionEngine.logOutcome()` and dismisses the item — but it never
 * completed the underlying task, so ticking a card here left the task open and
 * hid the reminder about it. It now goes through the canonical `complete`
 * action, which resolves the record AND closes the task where one can be found,
 * and says which of the two actually happened.
 *
 * **"Defer" POSTed `/api/focus/dismiss`.** So "not now" and "not mine"
 * collapsed into one gesture, and the difference — the thing the friction read
 * is built on — was thrown away at the moment Nick expressed it. The escalating
 * DEFER_MESSAGES that went with it ("You're avoiding this") are gone: they were
 * counted in `localStorage`, so the number was per-browser rather than a fact
 * about the work, and the wording was a claim about Nick that no evidence
 * supported. Deferrals are recorded server-side with a reason now, and
 * `FrictionSection` says what they add up to, neutrally.
 *
 * The card itself is `AttentionCard`, shared with Now and Briefing, so the
 * actions cannot come to mean three different things on three screens.
