/**
 * Brain Health — vault-graph maintenance, moved out of SAiM (31 Aug 2026).
 *
 * ── Why it lives here now ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * NEURO is the brain and the NEURO app is Nick's DIRECT access to it; SAiM is
 * the layer that comes to him. Vault maintenance is neither ambient nor
 * something SAiM should raise — it is a deliberate desk job you go and do,
 * with reports to read and consequences to weigh. It was on the phone as a
 * `brain` tab where the reports were unreadable and a button that rewrites
 * forty notes looked exactly like one that previews them.
 *
 * ── The two things the SAiM version got wrong ───────────────────────────────
 * 1. ⚠ **Read and WRITE were the same grey "Run" button.** `Plan links` is
 *    read-only; `Connect orphans` and `Apply links` edit real notes in the
 *    vault, and `PLAUD repull` re-downloads recordings. One undifferentiated
 *    list is how a preview gets confused for a dry run of nothing.
 * 2. ⚠ **Nothing said what an action would actually do.** "Preview contextual
 *    links (read-only)" does not tell you it appends a `## Mentioned` block
 *    under a marker, backs every touched file up first, and is idempotent.
 *    Without that you either never press it or press it blind.
 *
 * So: every option states what it READS, what it CHANGES, what it will NOT do,
 * and how to get back. Anything that writes is TWO-STEP — preview, then a
 * confirm that quotes the real number — which is the same shape as
 * `event-parser`, `one-to-one-booking` and `task-blocks`.
 */

/**
 * The same ranks the service uses. Only three are OFFERED here: `aggressive`
 * exists in the engine and is deliberately unreachable as a tier, because
 * applying every best guess at once is how a wrong link gets written into a
 * note nobody re-reads. A guess is reachable ONLY by being ticked, one at a time.
