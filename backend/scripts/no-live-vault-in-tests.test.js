/**
 * #119 — `npm test` used to write to the real vault.
 *
 * `npm test` is bare `node --test`, which globs `test-*.js`, `*-test.js`,
 * `*_test.js` and `test.js` anywhere under the cwd. All four Tier smoke scripts
 * were named `test-*.js`, so they ran on every invocation and were counted in
 * the suite total while asserting nothing. `test-tier1.js` defaulted
 * OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH to Nick's real vault and created a prep note and a meeting
 * note in it, unlinking them afterwards — so every test run churned a live
 * Syncthing-replicated vault, and a throw between create and unlink left a stray
 * note behind. It also made the suite count differ by machine, depending on
 * whether that hardcoded path resolved.
 *
 * Two things are pinned here, and the first is the load-bearing one: the scripts
 * are no longer DISCOVERABLE. Renaming them to `smoke-*` is what takes them out
 * of the suite; refusing to run without an explicit vault path is the belt to
 * that braces, and covers running one by hand.
