/**
 * Write the Scriptable scripts into the vault as Markdown notes.
 *
 * Why: they reach the phone by being COPIED AS TEXT, and the QR → Safari →
 * Select All route is both fiddly and lossy (it ate a backslash and produced a
 * syntax error). The vault already syncs to the phone and Obsidian puts a copy
 * button on every code block, so this is one tap instead of five.
 *
 * They land in `Scripts/`, which `vault-exclusions` already treats as a
 * TRANSIENT dir — so a few hundred lines of JavaScript never reach the
 * embeddings index or entity extraction. Putting them anywhere else would make
 * the source outrank real notes on half the vault's queries.
 *
 * ⚠ Exports EVERY Scriptable script, not one named file. The first version
 * knew only about the widget, so when a second script landed in the same
 * directory — reaching the phone the same way, with the same paste hazard — it
 * had no delivery route at all. Same shape as the no-backslash test, which had
 * the same fault for the same reason.
 *
 *   node backend/scripts/export-widget-to-vault.js [--dry-run]
 *
 * OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH overrides the vault location.
