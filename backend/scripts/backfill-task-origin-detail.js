/**
 * Recover the provenance detail for tasks that were promoted before the store
 * kept it.
 *
 * ── Why ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * An email-promoted task carries `origin_path: email:<Graph id>` and nothing
 * else, so the only thing a card could ever say about it was "an email". That
 * is task #251: MUST, high priority, due today, unidentifiable.
 *
 * The sender and subject were never lost — they are on the `capture_todo`
 * saim_action the task was promoted from, under `payload.email`, which is
 * matched to the task by `payload.sourcePath === tasks.origin_path`. This walks
 * that join and writes what it finds into `origin_detail`.
 *
 * ── Rules ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  - DRY RUN BY DEFAULT. `--apply` writes. It prints what it would do either
 *    way, so the confirm quotes real numbers rather than an estimate.
 *
 *  - It only ever fills a BLANK. A row that already carries detail is left
 *    alone and reported as skipped — this is a recovery pass, not an authority.
 *
 *  - A task whose action has been pruned is reported as UNRECOVERABLE by id,
 *    never quietly counted as done. The whole failure being fixed is a row that
 *    cannot say where it came from; a backfill that silently leaves some of
 *    them in that state, and prints a clean total, reproduces it.
 *
 *  - It writes NOTHING when the action carries no usable sender or subject.
 *    Storing `{"email":{}}` would make `describeTaskProvenance` report detail as
 *    recorded and then render nothing — a gap wearing the costume of an answer.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node backend/scripts/backfill-task-origin-detail.js            # dry run
 *   node backend/scripts/backfill-task-origin-detail.js --apply
