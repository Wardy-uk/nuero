/**
 * #83 — the todos route's suggestion list asked for 1,000 pending actions of
 * EVERY type and then discarded everything that was not a `capture_todo`.
 *
 * So the bound had to be large enough to swallow the entire pending queue just
 * to be correct about one type, and once the queue passed it the tail vanished
 * with no error and no signal. At the 930-action peak that was not theoretical:
 * `ORDER BY confidence DESC, created_at DESC` spans all types, so a genuine
 * capture_todo could be pushed past the cap by hundreds of rows the caller was
 * about to throw away.
 *
 * The tracker's premise ("the queue currently sits at 929") is stale — it was
 * measured at 4 on 16 Aug — so this is a latent bug, and these tests are what
 * stop it becoming a live one again.
