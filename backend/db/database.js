// later commits then reintroduced READERS of the table it left behind, so for

// place. `upsertTicket`, `clearStaleTickets`, `getAllTickets`,
// `getAtRiskTickets` and `getQueueSummary` are gone with their callers.
//
// ⚠ ESCALATIONS ARE UNAFFECTED and always were. `routes/escalation.js` queries
// Jira live via `/rest/api/3/search/jql` plus NOVA's escalation_log, and never
// touched this cache. SLA-at-risk awareness is what was given up here; if it is
