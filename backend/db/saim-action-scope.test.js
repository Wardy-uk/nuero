/**
 * The scoped saim_action reads, pinned against the bug that produced them.
 *
 * Three callers asked "have I already actioned this?" by pulling
 * `getRecentSaimActions(N)` and filtering the result. That is a GLOBAL recency
 * window, not a scoped query. The table churns thousands of rows a day, so by
 * 15 Aug the newest 500 covered about 21 hours — last night's actions for a
 * note were already outside it, the nightly vault scan found no prior action,
 * and it re-queued every candidate it had queued the night before. 926 pending
 * capture_todos, 442 of them distinct.
 *
 * The property that matters is simple and is the one these tests hold: a
 * scoped read must find a row NO MATTER HOW MANY newer rows exist. So each
 * test buries the row under more noise than any window would survive.
