--
-- The finding was that overtime was approved on headline indicators (ticket
-- counts, activity status) without cross-checking logged work, and that Working
-- Time Regulation limits were not considered at the point of approval. The plan
-- requires that from 27 Jul 2026 EVERY approval follows the five-step checklist
-- in Section 8 of the WTR briefing, each check recorded, with the line manager
-- auditing a sample at the 30/60/90-day checkpoints.

-- Wins — the derived ledger of finished work.
--
-- Measured before building: over 30 days NEURO recorded FOUR completions,
-- against 271 commits, 57 executed SARA actions and a full diary. The Momentum
-- card on the Today tab read 0 with no streak on every one of the nine visits
-- it got. The reward surface existed and was starved, because the only thing
-- feeding it was self-report — a tickbox — and self-report is the first thing
-- avoidance eats.
--
-- So a win is DETECTED, not declared. Same rule the rest of the system already

-- ── Task blocks — tasks pushed into the O365 calendar (18 Aug 2026) ──────────
--
-- Nick's rule, carried over from meetings: a block in the diary is a PLAN, not
-- finished work. `meeting-notes-source` will not count a meeting until the Plaud
-- note lands, because the note is what proves both that he was there and that
-- the meeting was processed. A time block has exactly the same hole and no Plaud
-- recording to close it — nobody records a solo work block — so the evidence is
-- an outcome note Nick writes.
--
-- **A block holds MANY tasks.** The first cut keyed the block on a single
-- task_id, and that is wrong for the way the work actually arrives: several
-- five-minute jobs belong in one thirty-minute window, and the whole point of
-- batching them is that they produce ONE write-up between them. Four separate
-- notes for one sitting is friction that would kill the feature. So the block is
-- the unit and `task_block_items` is the membership.
--
-- The window is chosen independently of what is in it — a 30-minute block may
-- hold 20 minutes of work, deliberately. Nothing here forces them to agree.
--
-- status:
--   scheduled        the block exists; nothing has been claimed about it yet
--   awaiting-writeup at least one member task has been ticked — HELD

--

--   applied         — the canonical record exists; `canonical_id` names it.
--   failed          — nothing was written; a replay is SAFE and expected.
--   rejected        — the operation was refused (unknown kind, bad payload).
--                     A replay changes nothing; the device must stop retrying.
--   pending         — a row written immediately before the work started, which
--                     can only survive a crash MID-APPLY. It is never replayed:
--                     a note may or may not have landed and re-applying would

-- ── Attention records (Phase 3, Gate 1 — 30 Aug 2026) ───────────────────────
--
-- The durable identity of a surfaced thing. Full contract in
-- `docs/attention-contract.md`.
--
-- Before this, an attention item lived for exactly one HTTP request:
-- decision-engine recomputed the pool on every call and the answer was rendered
-- and thrown away. So nothing could be ACKNOWLEDGED (the only durable state was
-- a suppression timer, which cannot tell "I have seen this" from "hide it for
-- 30 minutes" from "this is finished"), and a notification had no idea what it
-- was about — the governor deduped on a fingerprint of the TEXT, so a meeting
-- alert counting down produced a new fingerprint each time and passed cleanly.
--
-- ⚠ `dedupe_key` is the identity of the THING, not the engine's item id. Engine
-- ids are unstable by construction: `collectOverdueTodos` emits
-- `todo-overdue-top` for one overdue task and `todo-overdue-summary` for two, so
-- a dismissal recorded against one silently stopped applying the moment a second
-- task went overdue.
--
-- ⚠ Terminal states (resolved / expired / suppressed) NEVER re-match. If the
-- same dedupe_key appears again a NEW record is opened — which is what makes a
-- daily recurrence work without the key carrying a date, and what stops
-- yesterday's dismissal silencing today's standup.
--
-- `evidence` is never invented: an item with nothing citable stores `[]`, and
-- the notification gate refuses to interrupt on it. Surfacing without evidence
-- is fine (hiding real work on a bookkeeping failure is the worse error);
-- interrupting without it is not.

-- was measured (9 blind weekdays in three months, 0.16h logged against 8.21h
-- actually worked). This is the durable half. Same shape as health_daily:
-- materialised rather than derived on read, because the samples it is built from
-- age out of the ring within the day.

-- hosts double-counts an hour spent switching between them, and the raw samples
-- needed to take a union are gone by the time anyone asks.

-- ⚠ NO PRODUCTIVITY PULSE, by design. Measured r = -0.96 against meeting count:
-- it is a coding-vs-meetings ratio, and NEURO already derives both halves from
-- git and the calendar. Storing it would add a number that looks like insight
-- and carries none.
--
-- ⚠ `domains` holds BARE HOSTNAMES only. RescueTime's activity rows carry query
-- strings and OAuth parameters verbatim, and its account holds full window
-- titles; services/rescuetime.js cuts every value to a hostname before it gets
-- here, and restrict_kind=document is never requested.
