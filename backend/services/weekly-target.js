/**
 * Weekly target — the number Nick sets on a Monday, and how far through it he is.
 *
 * ── What it counts, and why not the whole wins ledger ────────────────────────
 *
 * A target has to count the thing being targeted. The `wins` ledger deliberately
 * counts everything finished — commits, meetings, replies, decisions, 1-2-1s —
 * and that is right for a momentum feed and WRONG for a target: at ~9 commits a
 * day a target of fifteen would be met by Tuesday lunchtime without a single
 * task being closed. That is exactly how the wins STREAK died — it jumped from 4
 * to 35 the moment meetings were counted honestly and became unbreakable, and a
 * number that cannot go down is not a signal.
 *
 * So this counts `kind = 'task_done'` and nothing else.
 *
 * ⚠ `task_done` specifically, and NOT also the `complete_task` SAiM action.
 * Executing that action calls `task-store.updateTask`, which logs `task_done` —
 * so both land in the ledger for one closed task, and counting both would
 * silently inflate every task Nick closes through SAiM. `task-store` is the ONE
 * writer of tasks, so every completion path (the phone, chat, MCP, a focus
 * session, an approved action) passes through it and is counted exactly once.
 *
 * ── The refusals ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. NO TARGET IS NOT A TARGET OF ZERO. `unset` is its own state and must never
 *    render as a full red ring — "you have done none of the nothing you set" is
 *    a discouraging way to say "you did not set one".
 *
 * 2. AN UNREADABLE LEDGER IS NOT AN EMPTY WEEK. `known:false` carries a reason.
 *    This is `wins`' own founding rule and it matters more here, because a ring
 *    at zero is a picture of a wasted week and pictures are believed faster than
 *    numbers.
 *
 * 3. NOTHING IS SET AUTOMATICALLY. `suggest()` proposes from history and says so
 *    (the `moscow_proposed` distinction — a proposal is not a decision). The
 *    target is a commitment Nick makes; a number NEURO picked for him is one he
 *    has no reason to feel anything about, which is the entire mechanism.
 *
 * Storage is a KV blob per week in `agent_state` (`weekly_target:<monday>`),
 * following `standup-session` and `focus-session`: a schema migration on the
 * live DB is a bigger risk than the query convenience is worth, and keying per
 * week means last week's target survives to be compared against.
 *
 * NB: it counts EVERY task, work and personal alike. When `tasks.domain` lands,
 * this is where the split goes — one target per domain, or a work-only target
 * with personal excluded. Deliberately not anticipated here.
