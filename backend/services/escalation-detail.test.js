// #54 — getUnseenEscalations() had been shipping status, priority and assignee
// through meta.escalations into Focus and Briefing, where nothing rendered any
// of them. The question was whether to show them or stop sending them, and the
// live data answered it rather than taste did.
//
// Measured over all 41 escalations Jira holds (not just the 6 open now, which
// would have said "always Unset, always Nick" and got this wrong):
//   priority — Unset 33, Normal 5, Major 2, Critical 1
//   assignee — Nick Ward 23, unassigned 7, five other people 11
//   status   — of the 6 open: Open 3, Reopened 2, Waiting on Development 1
//
// So neither "show all three" nor "drop all three" is right. Each field has a
// DEFAULT that is a fact about the queue rather than about the ticket, and a
// tail that is worth interrupting for. Suppress the default, keep the tail.
// Doing it in the service — not in each panel — is what stops Focus and
// Briefing drifting apart on what deserves a badge.
