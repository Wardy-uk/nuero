/**
 * The Scriptable widget must survive a copy/paste through Safari.
 *
 * It is the one file in this repo that reaches its runtime by being COPIED as
 * TEXT — scanned off a QR, selected in Safari, pasted into Scriptable — rather
 * than deployed. A backslash does not reliably survive that trip: `/\/+$/`
 * arrived on Nick's phone as a syntax error and the whole widget refused to
 * parse, which reads exactly like "the widget is broken" rather than "the
 * transport ate a character".
 *
 * Same species as the mistakes-log entry about regex-bearing JS in a heredoc.
 * The fix there was "don't send it through the pipeline"; here the pipeline is
 * unavoidable, so the file has to be written to survive it.
 *
 * Lives in backend/services because `node --test` is only run from backend/ —
 * it is not a backend service, and this comment is here so nobody moves it
 * somewhere "tidier" where it would silently stop running.
