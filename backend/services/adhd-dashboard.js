/**
 * ADHD dashboard — the "help me actually function today" view.
 *
 * The rest of NEURO answers "what is true?". This answers a different question:
 * "what does an ADHD brain need on the screen right now to get moving?" Those
 * pull in opposite directions, so the rules here are deliberate:
 *
 *   1. ONE thing, never a list. A list of 101 overdue tasks is a threat display —
 *      it restates the anxiety instead of giving somewhere to start. Everything
 *      else on this page is support for the one thing.
 *   2. Evidence of progress, prominently. ADHD memory drops completed work, so
 *      the day feels like nothing happened even when it didn't. Wins get shown
 *      back with the same weight as what's outstanding.
 *   3. Avoidance named as data, never as judgement. "Snoozed 5 times" is a fact
 *      that helps. "You keep avoiding this" is shame, and shame feeds the loop.
 *   4. Quick wins available on demand. Activation energy is the blocker, so
 *      there is always a 2-minute option when the main thing is too big.
 *   5. Counts are shown next to what to DO about them, or not at all.
 *
 * Deterministic — no LLM. Same discipline as the decision engine, and for the
 * same reason: this has to be instant and identical every time it loads.

 * was self-report.
 *
 * The wins ledger DETECTS finished work instead — the same rule as "who reports
 * to Nick is READ, not typed" and "1-2-1s are detected, not declared". `gaps`
 * travels with it so a source that could not be read is named on the card
 * rather than quietly lowering the number, which is the failure mode this whole
