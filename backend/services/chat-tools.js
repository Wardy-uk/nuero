/**
 * Chat tools — the bridge that lets SARA *do* things during a conversation.
 *
 * Until now chat was read-only RAG: context in, prose out. "Mark that done",
 * "book me an hour for it", "reply to Chris" were all impossible by construction,
 * because the model had no way to reach the services that already do those jobs.
 *
 * Three tiers, and the tier is the safety model:
 *
 *   read     — no side effects at all. Always allowed.
 *   write    — reversible and internal (task store, daily note). Runs immediately;
 *              Nick can undo it in the UI in one tap.
 *   queued   — leaves the building (email, calendar invites). NEVER executed here.
 *              These queue a pending sara_action and return its id, so the send
 *              happens only after an explicit approval through /api/actions.
 *
 * Tool calling needs a provider that supports it. Anthropic is Tier 1 in
 * ai-routing and the SDK is already a dependency; OpenAI/OpenRouter/Ollama fall
 * back to the old text-only path rather than pretending. See claude.js.
