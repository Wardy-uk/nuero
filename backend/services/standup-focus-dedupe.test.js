/**
 * One job must appear ONCE in Focus Today.
 *
 * The fixtures are Nick's real standup of 27 Aug 2026, which rendered six focus
 * lines for three jobs — "Review Vantage prototype and sign off" byte-identically
 * twice, and "Verify and compile her response" beside "Verify and compile
 * Phillipa's email response".
 *
 * This matters beyond tidiness because today's `## Focus Today` is what
 * standup-accountability parses tomorrow as the carry source. Every duplicate is
 * re-read the next morning as another distinct open commitment, so the list
 * breeds — which is how SAiM came to open a standup insisting on "four
 * escalations" Nick had never committed to and could not find in his calendar.
