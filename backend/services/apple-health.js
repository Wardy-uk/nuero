 * Apple Health ingestion — the transport half of #40.
 *
 * The FreeReps iOS companion app (App Store id6760661354) posts HealthKit data
 * straight here. There is no FreeReps server, no Postgres and no poller: the
 * app's networking is a bare `POST {base}/api/v1/ingest/` with a JSON body and
 * **no credentials of any kind** — its config model has exactly seven fields
 * (host, port, useHTTPS, testMode, testHost, testPort, backfillMonths) and none
 * of them is a token. It uses a default URLSession with no delegate, so there is
 * no certificate pinning either, and `useHTTPS` is a toggle. Verified by reading
 * the app source, not assumed.
 *
 * That is why this module exists rather than a client for FreeReps' own API:
 * standing up a Go server and a TimescaleDB purely to receive a JSON POST and
 * hand it on would have meant a second copy of every reading and an
 * eventual-consistency gap between two stores.
 *
 * This file is PURE — parsing and mapping only, no DB and no network — so the
 * wire contract can be pinned by tests without a database. Same split as
 * `pi-health.assess()` and `one-to-one-detect.cadenceState()`.
 *
 * Payload is Health Auto Export format:
 *   { data: { metrics: [ { name, units, data: [ { date, qty, source_uuid,
 *                                                Min, Avg, Max } ] } ],
 *             category_samples: [ { id, type, value, value_label,
 *                                   start_date, end_date, source } ],

// the stress baseline, so the HAE name is mapped onto the existing one instead.

// whole-night sample from a second source. They are two accounts of the same
// sleep, so adding them double-counts the night to ~2x. `asleepHours` therefore
// PREFERS the staged sum and falls back to the unspecified value only when
// there is no staged sleep at all (3 nights of 728), and `asleepSource` says
// which answered — the same honesty rule working-days.status() follows.
//
// Preferring staged is not a coin toss. Measured over the 324 both-source
// nights, the unspecified sample disagrees by more than half an hour on 241 of
// them, in BOTH directions: it over-states by up to 3.4h and under-states by up
// to 9.7h (2025-05-24 recorded 0.33h against 10.08h of staged sleep). It is not
// a reliable whole-night figure, and the staged segments are the ones the card
// is built to draw.
