//                Excluded from indexing, but a linker resolving link TARGETS

// ── Sensitive, and why it is NOT the same as "personal" ──────────────────────
//
// ⚠ `Personal/` in this vault does NOT mean personal life. Read before changing:
// it holds Nick's disciplinary prep and the fraud investigation, his GP
// appointment notes (anxiety, depression, ADHD) and three Occupational Health
// documents naming the external assessor and the HR contact. It is the most
// sensitive content in the vault and it is WORK material, not home life.
//
// That distinction is load-bearing in both directions. Treating this folder as
// "personal life" would have hidden his OH and disciplinary history from the
// work surfaces where it is genuinely relevant, AND left actual family notes
// indexed — wrong twice from one wrong assumption.
//
// What sensitive buys: excluded from ENTITY EXTRACTION, so an HR officer, an
// occupational health assessor and a GP do not enter the person graph, get
// ranked on somebody's mentions page, or become a `people-gap` stub proposing a
// People note for the person who handled Nick's disciplinary.
//
// What it deliberately does NOT buy: exclusion from embeddings. This is Nick's
// own brain and he must be able to ask it about his own OH report; removing it
// from search would be a real loss for a threat that is largely internal. The
// outbound guards are what stop it leaving the building.
// ⚠ BOTH names are listed, and that is not indecision — it is what makes the
// folder rename safe to do in either order. If the code said only 'Personal'
// and Nick renamed the folder first, `Private/` would be unprotected until the
// next deploy: entity extraction would walk it again and the HR officer, the OH
// assessor and his GP would re-enter the person graph, silently, exactly as they
// had been. This guard fails OPEN, so there must be no window where the folder
// is not covered by whatever name it currently has.
//
// The old name can be dropped once the rename has actually happened — but a
// stale entry here costs nothing, and removing it early costs everything.
