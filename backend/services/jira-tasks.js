/**
 * Tickets assigned to Nick, as tasks Jira closes.
 *
 * ── Why this exists, and why it is shaped like this ──────────────────────────
 *
 * Nothing in NEURO had ever asked Jira what was assigned to Nick. The only JQL
 * in the repo was the escalation pair, so the working escalation code was not a
 * broken version of this — it is a different feature that got built instead. A
 * ticket sitting in Nick's name was known to Jira and to nothing else.
 *
 * Nick's decision (3 Sep 2026) settles the hard part. These become REAL tasks,
 * linked to the ticket, with NEURO's own fields (due date, MoSCoW, estimate)
 * editable as normal — **but there is no manual tick**. Completion is driven by
 * the ticket's own status, so there is never two places to close one thing.
 * That is the whole design, and everything below follows from it:
 *
 *  - **The refusal lives in `task-store.updateTask`**, not in a route. Every
 *    completion path in the estate — the todos routes, the SAiM funnel, the MCP
 *    tool, the chat tool — arrives through that one function, and a guard in any
 *    one of them is a guard the other three walk past. (The same argument the
 *    task-blocks write-up hold is built on.)
 *  - **Closing is a SEPARATE read, not an absence.** A ticket missing from
 *    "assigned to me and not done" could be done, reassigned, moved to a project
 *    the token cannot see, or deleted — and only the first is a reason to mark
 *    Nick's work finished. So the sync asks Jira about the linked keys directly
 *    and closes only on `statusCategory === 'done'`. Absence of evidence is not
 *    evidence, which is this codebase's oldest lesson and the one that costs
 *    most here: a wrongly closed task is work that silently stops existing.
 *  - **Unassignment is not completion.** A ticket taken off Nick is no longer
 *    his, but it was not finished by him and may not be finished at all. The
 *    task is UNLINKED and left open with a note, so he can decide — the
 *    conservative half of `release()`'s rule that a reason is always required.
 *
 * The link lives in `agent_state.jira_task_links` (key → task id). A KV ledger
 * rather than a column, following `ms_todo_list_by_task` and `ms_push_queue`:
 * it is an annotation on the relationship between two systems, and a schema
 * migration on a 547MB live database is a bigger risk than the query
 * convenience is worth. It is PERSISTED because the backend restarts several
 * times a day and an in-memory link would re-create every task on every deploy.

 * `feature-flags.js` exists to undo: the value could only change with an .env
 * edit and a pm2 restart, so the switch the scheduler's own comment claims
 * "needs no restart to be read" demonstrably did. The environment still WINS
