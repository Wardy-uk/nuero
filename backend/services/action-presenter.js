/**
 * How to render a pending SAiM action so it can be approved SAFELY.
 *
 * This exists because the approval screen and the executor have to agree, and
 * the only way they stay agreed is if the description is derived on the server,
 * next to `suggestion-engine.executeAction`, from the SAME stored payload the
 * executor will read. Rebuilding the summary in the frontend gives you a screen
 * free to drift from what actually sends — which for outbound email is the
 * whole risk.
 *
 * Three things every entry owes the caller:
 *
 *   1. `body` — the full text, verbatim, for anything outbound. Not a summary.
 *      You cannot approve an email to a direct report from a one-line gist.
 *   2. `blockers` — the executor's own `{ ok:false }` guards, restated. A
 *      non-empty list means approve is DISABLED and the reason is on screen,
 *      rather than an approve that quietly fails.
 *   3. `warnings` — things that are true, survivable, and worth reading first
 *      (this one emails eight people; this one has no stored address).
 *
 * Only guards that can be checked from the payload alone live here. Anything
 * needing I/O (does the waiting-on item still exist, is Microsoft signed in) is
 * the executor's to discover and report — a blocker that needs a Graph call is
 * a blocker that makes the list slow and still sometimes wrong.
 *
 * `KIND` drives how loud the card is:
 *   outbound — leaves the building. Real email, real Teams DM, real invites.
 *   write    — changes NEURO or the vault. Reversible, internal.
 *   navigate — changes nothing; approving it just moves the screen.
