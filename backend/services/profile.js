/**
 * What SAiM knows about Nick as a person.
 *
 * ── The measurement that made this necessary ────────────────────────────────
 * Taken 31 Aug 2026, across ~6,000 vault notes:
 *
 *   Meetings 263 · Plaud 417 · People 42 · Projects 14 folders
 *   Personal/ ......... 6 notes, ALL of them disciplinary prep, GP appointment
 *                       prep and occupational health. Work-adjacent and
 *                       sensitive, not "who Nick is".
 *   Non-work anything . ONE. `Projects/D&D`.
 *
 * So `WHO_IS_NICK` telling her the record is work-heavy and to ask rather than
 * assume was not hedging. It was the literal state: she can see his body, his
 * diary and his laptop, and has no idea what he would want to do with a free
 * evening.
 *
 * ── Why it is not a form ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The obvious fix is an "About Me" note he maintains. It would rot. His failure
 * mode is avoidance and drift, and everything in this system that WORKS follows
 * one rule instead: *detected, not declared*. Who reports to him is read from
 * People notes. 1-2-1s are detected from meeting notes. Wins are detected —
 * that one exists precisely BECAUSE the hand-typed version recorded four
 * completions in a month he shipped 271 commits in.
 *
 * Nick's own design (31 Aug): seed it from the memory Claude and ChatGPT have
 * already accumulated, enrich it with a one-time interview run from NEURO, and
 * let SAiM add to it as she learns. So the only typing is a paste and one
 * conversation, and after that it grows by being used.
 *
 * ── The rules ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ⚠ **EVERY FACT CARRIES ITS SOURCE.** A line from a ChatGPT memory dump is
 * weaker evidence than something he said last Tuesday, and SAiM must be able to
 * tell — "I think you mentioned" is a different sentence from "you told me".
 * Nothing goes in unattributed.
 *
 * ⚠ **NOTHING IS INVENTED.** The seed ingest RESTRUCTURES prose into facts and
 * may not add one. A profile that quietly acquires an interest he does not have
 * is worse than an empty one, because he would have no reason to distrust it.
 *
 * ⚠ **IT IS NOT `Personal/`.** That folder holds the disciplinary prep, the
 * fraud investigation and three occupational-health documents, and VESTA refuses
 * it outright. Hobbies do not belong next to an OH report, and this note should
 * not inherit that refusal for the wrong reason. It lives in `Me/`.
 *
 * ⚠ **NEVER SHARED.** Not to VESTA, not to a catalogue, not anywhere outside
 * NEURO. It is the most personal thing in the vault by construction.
 *
 * ⚠ **It must actually be CONSUMED.** Three separate things were found today
 * that computed something nothing ever read — `health-signals`' trends, the Jira
 * cache's readers, the ambient layer before it was wired. A profile nothing
 * injects is the same bug with a friendlier name, so `contextBlock()` exists and
 * is wired into chat before anything else here is worth having.
 *
 * PURE where it judges: `parse`, `render` and `contextBlock` take plain data.
 *
 * CommonJS — NEURO backend convention.
