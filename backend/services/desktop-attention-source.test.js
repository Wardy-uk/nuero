 * `/api/focus/action-done` when Nick pressed "Do it". That route calls
 * `nextActionEngine.logOutcome()` and `engine.dismiss()` — so the button that
 * merely OPENED a thing recorded it as a completed outcome and hid the card.
 * The card vanishing looks exactly like the button having worked, which is why
 * it survived so long.
 *
 * There is no state of the world in which starting or opening something should
 * log a completion, so the assertion is absolute: no desktop panel references
 * that route at all. A grep is the right shape of test here — the failure was a
 * URL string, and the desktop has no test runner of its own.
 *
 * Lives in backend/services because `node --test` is only run from backend/.
 * It is not a backend service, and this comment is here so nobody moves it
 * somewhere "tidier" where it would silently stop running.
