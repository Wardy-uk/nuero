 *

 * inspected by hand when a fold looks wrong, and six callers outside this module
 * compute it and look a task up by it. A hash would answer the collision
 * question and make every one of those debugging sessions harder.
 *
 * ⚠ Changing this changes every stored key, so `rekeyAll()` below exists and
 * runs at startup. Without it, a task whose text is longer than 80 characters
 * would stop being findable by its own key the moment this shipped — the mirror

  // outcome note was written, on the reasoning that a window in the diary is
  // not evidence the work happened. That reasoning still stands about the
  // BLOCK. It was never true of the TASK, and the measurement is unambiguous:
  // across the whole life of the feature the sweep logged `0 completed` on
  // every single pass — not one block has ever been closed by a write-up.
  // What the hold actually did was delay every completion by ~24h until the
  // ageing pass released the block, and leave the task at `in-progress`, which
  // the read path reports as plain `open` — so it presented as a checkbox that
  // did nothing. A rule that has never once produced its intended outcome and
  // reliably produces a dead control is not a safeguard, it is a bug with a
  // rationale.
  //
  // ⚠ The tick still PROPAGATES: every open block holding this task has its
  // item marked and its note's checklist rewritten, or the block and the task
  // list disagree about work Nick has just finished — the two-screens problem
  // `setTickEverywhere` exists to end.
  //
  // ⚠ Order is load-bearing: this runs AFTER the row is written, because
  // `refreshBlockStatus` decides whether a block still owes a write-up by
  // asking whether its ticked items are done. Run before the write and every
  // block flips to `awaiting-writeup` for work that is already finished.

 * Bring every stored `dedupe_key` up to the current KEY_LENGTH.

 * said so — `getTaskByDedupeKey` would simply return nothing and every caller
 * would carry on as though the task did not exist.
 *
 * Idempotent: it only writes where the recomputed key differs, so a second run
 * reports zero. Safe to widen through: a longer key is strictly more specific
 * than the prefix it extends, so two rows that were distinct at 80 cannot
 * collide at 200.
 *
 * ⚠ A row that WOULD collide is left alone and reported rather than written.
 * That can only happen if two rows already share a longer prefix through some
 * route this does not know about, and in that case refusing keeps both rows
