/**
 * Outcomes — does any of this actually work?

 * Everything else in NEURO measures the machine: Pi temperature, provider mix,
 * queue depth, sync status. Nothing measured whether the system was helping the
 * person it was built for, which meant every decision about what to build next
 * was taste rather than evidence.
 *
 * Seven signals, all derived from data already being collected. No new
 * instrumentation — this is a rollup and a view.
 *
 * The one that matters most is nagPressure. If snoozes and dismissals climb
 * while everything else looks healthy, the system is generating compliance
 * rather than help, and the right response is to build LESS. A measurement
 * layer that can only ever justify more features is not measuring anything.
 *
 * Snapshots are stored per ISO week rather than recomputed from history, so a
 * later change to how a metric is defined doesn't silently rewrite the past.
