/**
 * The Pi kiosk, guarded from the backend suite.
 *
 * `sara/frontend` has no test runner of its own, and on 30 Aug that showed:
 * three real bugs in the Presence screen were caught by SSHing to the Pi,
 * screenshotting the DSI panel with `grim` and looking at the picture. That
 * worked, and it is not a gate — nobody will do it on the next change.
 *
 * Reading another workspace's source from here is the established pattern
 * (`action-surfaces.test.js` reads the shared tab registry for exactly this
 * reason: neither half errors on its own, so only a test spanning both catches
 * the disagreement).
 *
 * ⚠ REWRITTEN 31 Aug 2026. This file used to assert things about the kiosk's
 * own fourteen-screen registry and its ViewRouter. Both are gone: the kiosk
 * mounts the phone's registry and the two shells are one app. Testing a
 * registry that no longer routes anything would be the same species of
 * dead-but-green as the suite that was passing over VESTA's never-working task
 * path. What is left is what still has to be true.
