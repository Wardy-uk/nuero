 * A task card must be able to say when it arrived and how.
 *
 * Pinned here rather than in a route test because the describer is PURE — it
 * takes a row and a clock and returns words, so the rules that matter (an
 * opaque id is never a label; an unknown source is named as itself; a missing
 * date is never today) pin without a database, a vault or a network.
 *
 * The live case that motivated it is a fixture: task #251, source
 * `email-promotion`, `origin_path: email:AAMk…` — a MUST due today that Nick
 * could not identify at all.
