// Three separate blindnesses, all of which let SAiM chase a commitment Nick had
// closed and told her about at EOD the night before:
//   1. the EOD **Done:** bullets were written into the daily note and parsed by
//      nothing, so the only durable record of that conversation was discarded
//      (the session itself lives in agent_state under its own date and is never
//      loaded again);
//   2. _renderContext read acc.yesterday.focus, a key that object has never
//      carried, so every standup opened with "committed to 0 things, 0 done"
//      however full the note was;
//   3. nothing read completions at all — the task context is the OPEN pool, so
//      a task closed yesterday leaves it and leaves no trace.
