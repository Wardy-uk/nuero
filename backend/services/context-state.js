/**
 * Context state — what NEURO believes Nick is doing RIGHT NOW.
 *
 * NEURO is the brain; SARA is the voice, ears and eyes. That division makes the
 * inference NEURO's job, not SARA's. `sara/backend/src/state/inference.js` had
 * started to grow a second one — an activity enum, a confidence model and a
 * recommended-view map — but its inputs were SEEDED (`state/seed.js`), so it was
 * a second opinion assembled from data that did not exist. The rules and the
 * honesty are ported here; the four-domain contract they sat on is not, because
 * that shape was invented for the seed and NEURO has real inputs instead.
 *
 * PURE. No DB, no network, no clock — `now` is passed in. Same split as
 * `pi-health.assess()`, `one-to-one-detect.cadenceState()` and
 * `state-of-play.assess()`: the judgement is the product, so it has to pin
 * without a Pi, a vault or a date rollover.
 *
 * ⚠ The load-bearing rule is that a MISSING input is never a zero. `known:false`
 * on the queue means "we could not look", and reading that as "nothing is
 * breaching" is how a dashboard reports a false all-clear (`weekly-risk`'s
 * `greenPct` lesson, and `wins`'s "a failed source is a GAP, never a zero").
 * Anything we could not see lands in `unknowns` and costs confidence.
 *
 * `steady` and `unknown` are therefore DIFFERENT facts: steady means we looked
 * and nothing stood out; unknown means we could not look.
 *
 * CommonJS only — NEURO backend convention.
