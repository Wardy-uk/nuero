/**
 * The half-day planner — the thing that puts the work in the diary without
 * being asked.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `task-blocks` has been able to block time since 18 Aug and
 * has been used exactly once, for a ten-task test block closed five minutes in.
 * Grep it for `webpush`: no matches. Its only scheduled hook is `sweep()`, which
 * asks "has the outcome note been written yet?" — a detector, not a driver. So
 * the feature could see whether Nick had done the work and could never tell him
 * to start it, and creating a block cost six deliberate steps on a desktop
 * screen he had to remember existed. Nick's own words on finding it again:
 * "I forgot we had that."
 *
 * Vantage's README states the constraint this is built against: his difficulty
 * is INITIATION, not knowledge, and "anything that raises awareness without
 * lowering the barrier is the wrong shape". A planner that proposes and waits
 * raises awareness. One that has already put the blocks in the diary lowers the
 * barrier. That is the whole design.
 *
 * THE HALF-DAY HORIZON is Nick's call (27 Aug): plan the morning at 07:15, plan
 * the afternoon at lunch. It is better than planning a whole day at dawn,
 * because his diary moves under him — an afternoon planned at 07:15 is planned
 * against a calendar that no longer exists by 13:00.
 *
 * Split like `pi-health.assess()` / `state-of-play`: `planWindow()` is PURE and
 * holds every judgement worth pinning; `run()` does the I/O and the writing.

// ── Capacity: what the body has to give today ────────────────────────────────
//
// NEURO has held two years of sleep, HRV and resting heart rate and never once
// let it change what it asked of Nick. This is the one place it should: not
// another card telling him he slept badly — he knows — but a lighter morning
// actually appearing in his diary on the day after a bad night.
//
// THREE RULES, and the asymmetry is deliberate.
//
//  1. IT ONLY EVER REDUCES. A well-recovered day plans exactly as before. Making
//     a good night buy a busier morning turns a health reading into a demand,
//     and the caps above were set against how his days actually go, not against
//     how rested he is.
//  2. UNKNOWN PLANS AS NORMAL. No watch, no baseline, a failed read — all plan
//     the full default. The planner refusing to work because a phone did not
//     sync is a worse failure than planning one block too many, and "fail open
//     on unknown" is the rule the leave check and the availability feed already
//     follow.
//  3. IT DOES NOT REORDER THE WORK. Tempting to put the easy job first on a bad
//     day; that is `rankTasks` overruled by a heart-rate reading, and it turns
//     the plan into the quick-wins list this file already refuses to become.
//     Less work, in the same order.

  maxTasks: MAX_TASKS_PER_BLOCK,
  reduced: false,
  note: null,
};

// ⚠ DEFAULT OFF, and the reason is a measurement rather than caution.
//
// The obvious justification for this rule is "Nick gets less done on low
// recovery days, so plan less". That was tested before shipping it
// (backend/scripts/measure-health-work.js) against 743 rolled-up days and the
// 89 where the wins ledger overlaps them, bucketing each day by a readiness
// score built ONLY from the days before it. The answer was no:
//
//   low readiness    25 days   mean output 8.08
//   normal or high   64 days   mean output 7.92
//   permutation p = 0.97
//
// There is no effect there to build on. (Only 5 short nights fell in the
// overlap, so the sleep arm could not be tested at all — that is reported as
// untested, not as a null result.) The measurement is weak rather than
// decisive: n=89 and the wins count is a noisy proxy, skewed by commit-heavy
// days. So this is not evidence the rule is wrong; it is the absence of the
// evidence that would make it right.
//
// Which leaves it as a PREFERENCE, not a prediction — "plan me a lighter
// morning when my recovery is down" is a perfectly reasonable thing to want,
// and a completely different claim from "you will get less done". Nick turns it
// on if he wants it. Shipping it on by default would be NEURO quietly acting on
// a correlation it went and looked for and did not find.
