/**
 * Calendar sync — fill the cache nothing was filling.
 *
 * `db.upsertCalendarEvent` has existed, been exported, and been called by
 * absolutely nothing. `calendar_cache` has therefore always been empty, and
 * every feature reading it has been quietly dark:
 *
 *   - working-memory sets ctx.calendar from the cache, so it was always []
 *   - decision-engine.collectMeetings() never produced an item, so a meeting
 *     has never appeared in Focus
 *   - briefing.checkMeetingAlerts() reads the same context, so the "starting in
 *     10 minutes" push has never fired once
 *   - the chat get_calendar tool and the ADHD dashboard both returned nothing
 *
 * It went unnoticed because the calendar VIEWS call Graph live — the screens
 * looked right while everything that reasons about the calendar was blind.
 *
 * Sync is replace-by-window rather than merge: a meeting that gets cancelled or
 * moved must disappear, and diffing for deletions against Graph is more work
 * than simply rewriting the window.
