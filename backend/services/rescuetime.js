/**
 * RescueTime, as a SECOND OPINION that is continuously audited.
 *
 * ── Why this exists, and why it is shaped like this ─────────────────────────
 * Nick already pays for RescueTime and asked (2 Sep 2026) whether pulling its
 * API would beat the desktop agent NEURO owns. Measured over three months
 * against that agent and the wins ledger, it did not:
 *
 *   - 9 blind weekdays where NEURO held hard evidence of a full working day,
 *   - 19% of all recorded work sitting on days RescueTime saw nothing,
 *   - and 1 Sep, where it reported 0.16h against 8.21h of measured active time
 *     ON THE MACHINE IT WAS INSTALLED ON.
 *
 * The finding was never "RescueTime is inaccurate". It is that a stopped
 * RescueTime looks EXACTLY like a quiet Tuesday, from inside RescueTime. Its own
 * dashboard was green throughout.
 *
 * So this integration takes the two things RescueTime genuinely has and refuses
 * the one it does not:
 *
 *  ✓ CATEGORIES — how a day split across kinds of work.
 *  ✓ BROWSER DOMAINS — the one real gap in NEURO's own sensor, which collapses
 *    every browser to "chrome" by design.
 *  ✗ THE PRODUCTIVITY PULSE. Measured r = -0.96 against meeting count: it is a
 *    coding-vs-meetings ratio, and NEURO already derives both halves from git
 *    and the calendar. Storing it would add a number that looks like insight and
 *    carries none. It is not fetched, not stored, not exposed.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE AGREEMENT CHECK IS THE FEATURE, not a nicety. `desktop_daily` is an
 * independent, local measurement of the same machine on the same day, which
 * RescueTime cannot influence. Every RescueTime figure is therefore checkable,
 * and the senses row answers "does RescueTime agree with what was measured?"
 * rather than "did the API respond?" — the second is what was green all August.
 *
 * ── The privacy line ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ⚠ Activity rows are NOT clean. A real row pulled on 2 Sep 2026 read:
 *
 *   web.plaud.ai&response_type=code id_token&scope=name email&response_mode=...
 *
 * — an OAuth flow with its parameters attached. RescueTime holds full window
 * titles and document names (which on this machine means Outlook subject lines,
 * customer names and a disciplinary folder); this integration must never carry
 * any of it into NEURO, where it would reach vault embeddings and cloud model
 * prompts. `sanitiseActivity()` cuts to the bare hostname and nothing else, and
 * `restrict_kind=document` is never requested.
 *
 * PURE where it judges: parsing, sanitising and the agreement rules take plain
 * values, so all of it pins without a key or a network.
 *
 * CommonJS — NEURO backend convention.

 *
 * ⚠ WHY IT MATTERS FROM 13 Sep 2026: RescueTime is installed on the Mac, and
 * NEURO's own agent is NOT — `desktop_daily` has one host. RescueTime's API

 * `measured` is a single machine. The ratio can then only inflate, and the check
 * only fires BELOW the floor — so RescueTime could go blind on the laptop and
 * still clear it on Mac hours alone. That is precisely the failure this audit was
 * built to catch (nine blind weekdays; 0.16h reported against 8.21h measured),
