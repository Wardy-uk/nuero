/**
 * Completing a task Microsoft owns — the ONE implementation.
 *
 * ── Why it is a service and not a route body ────────────────────────────────
 * This was the body of `POST /api/todos/complete-ms` and nothing else could
 * reach it. That was fine while the only way to tick a Microsoft task was the
 * task list; it stopped being fine the moment the attention feed grew a "Done"
 * button, because the alternative was a second copy of the mirror flip, the
 * Graph push, the recurrence repaint, the webhook fallback and the retry queue —
 * five things that must agree, in two places, drifting from the first edit on.
 *
 * ── What "completing" a Microsoft task actually involves ────────────────────
 *   1. flip the mirror line in `Tasks/Microsoft Tasks.md` (what NEURO reads);
 *   2. record the win — the ledger is blind to two of the three task owners
 *      unless someone tells it;
 *   3. push to Graph;
 *   4. if the task RECURS, repaint the mirror to what Microsoft now holds;
 *   5. if Graph refused, try the Power Automate webhook;
 *   6. if neither landed, HOLD it in the push queue — the mirror is already
 *      ticked and is regenerated from Graph every 30 minutes, so without this
 *      the completion is silently undone inside the half hour.
 *
 * ── The one thing this file adds ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ⚠ THE MIRROR LINE IS RESOLVED BY ID, NEVER BY A SUPPLIED OFFSET. A caller may
 * hand in a `lineNumber` captured minutes or hours ago — an attention card
 * generated at the last poll, a lane fetched before a resync — and this file is
 * rewritten wholesale every sync, so that offset can name a DIFFERENT task by
 * the time Nick presses the button, and `toggleTask` would tick that one. The
 * next sync does not undo it: it reads the wrong task as open again and the
 * right one as never done. A mirror line that cannot be found by id is skipped
 * with a reason — never a thrown error, because the Graph push is the half that
 * matters and an unreadable vault must not cost the completion.

/**
 * Record that a task NEURO does not own was finished.
 *
 * The wins ledger is built on the `task_done` activity event and `task-store` is
 * its only writer — but task-store owns just ONE of the three things a tick can
 * close. A Microsoft task and a plain vault checkbox logged nothing, so
 * finishing either moved no number anywhere: Momentum, "Done today" and the
 * weekly-target ring were all blind to two thirds of what Nick can tick.
 *
 * ⚠ It must not double-count a LINKED task. `saim/app`'s completeTask calls
 * `/api/tasks/:id/complete` AND the Microsoft path for a row carrying both ids
 * (task-dedupe links them, NEURO leading), so task-store has already logged that
 * completion by the time this runs. `tasks.ms_id` is the single answer to "is
 * this linked", so it is what gets asked. Inflating is strictly worse than
 * missing: a missed win is a visible absence, an invented one makes every other
 * number suspect.
 *
 * Failure is swallowed. The task is closed by the time this runs, and a
 * bookkeeping error must never surface as "that didn't work" and send Nick back
 * to tick it again (`sent-replies`' rule).
