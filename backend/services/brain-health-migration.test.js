/**
 * Brain Health lives in NEURO, not SAiM (31 Aug 2026).
 *
 * NEURO is the brain and the NEURO app is Nick's DIRECT access to it; SAiM is
 * the layer that comes to him. Vault maintenance is neither ambient nor
 * something SAiM should raise — it is a deliberate desk job with reports to
 * read and writes to weigh. On the phone it was a `brain` tab where the reports
 * were unreadable and a button that rewrites forty notes looked exactly like
 * one that previews them.
 *
 * ⚠ Removing a SAiM tab is never only a deletion: a tab id missing from
 * `SAIM_LITE_TABS` routes its notifications to Focus IN SILENCE. The kind
 * `brain` is deliberately kept (the desktop still routes it to Imports); only
 * its SAiM destination is gone, so it now falls through to the Surface like
 * everything else with no dedicated tab.
 *
 * Source scans, because the alternative is booting three frontends. Each has a
 * positive control so a pass cannot come from a moved file or a typo'd path.
