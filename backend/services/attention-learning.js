/**
 * What SARA learns from whether her prompts actually helped.
 *
 * Nick, 31 Aug 2026: *"SARA also needs to learn — what do I ignore, what do I
 * respond to, how can she help me better."* Then, on what she should do about
 * it: *"I think she goes quiet — but I need to know somehow. Maybe SARA should
 * initiate and run the End of Day routine — she can tell me there what I've
 * ignored and what she's muted, and I can ask her to resume any I want."*
 *
 * So: she quietens herself, and the EOD is where that is confessed and undone.
 * That is what makes going quiet safe — a system that mutes itself silently is
 * indistinguishable from one that has broken, which is the failure `signals.js`
 * exists to make impossible.
 *
 * ── ⚠ MEASURE THE OUTCOME, NOT HIS ATTENTION ────────────────────────────────
 * The obvious measure is "did he open the app after the prompt". It is WRONG,
 * and water is the case that proves it: he gets a glass and does not log it.
 * "Ignored" and "acted on and never told me" are indistinguishable that way —
 * and it is exactly the signal he most wants tuned.
 *
 * It would also break a rule this codebase already holds twice over: *a missed
 * check-in means nothing, being heads-down is why one gets skipped*
 * (`focus-session`), and `friction.js` refuses to read absence at all.
 *
 * So the question is never "did he respond". It is **did the world change** —
 * measured from sensors SARA already reads:
 *
 *   sedentary     did `apple_stand_time` appear in the next hour?      MEASURABLE
 *   no-exercise   did exercise minutes appear within two days?         MEASURABLE
 *   long-focus    did the foreground app change, or go idle?           MEASURABLE
 *   low-water     did a `dietary_water` sample appear?      only if he is logging
 *   not-eaten     did `dietary_energy_consumed` appear?     only if he is logging
 *   health-signal not that kind of prompt                            NEVER JUDGED
 *
 * ⚠ **UNMEASURABLE IS NOT IGNORED.** If the outcome cannot be seen, the delivery
 * is recorded and scored as nothing at all. It does not count towards muting, in
 * either direction. Counting it as a failure would mute the water prompt for the
 * precise reason it is working — he drank and did not log it — which is the
 * dumbest possible thing this file could do.
 *
 * ── Muting is conservative, and it is never silent ──────────────────────────
 * `MIN_JUDGED` before an opinion exists at all, and a rate low enough that it is
 * not a run of bad luck. A mute stops the PUSH and never hides the observation:
 * it still renders on the Surface, the widget and Now. That is
 * `attention-lifecycle`'s acknowledged rule — seen means it stops asking, not
 * that it disappears.
 *
 * PURE where it judges: `outcomeWindow`, `rate` and `shouldMute` take plain data
 * and a clock. Only the recording and the sweep read or write.
 *
 * CommonJS — NEURO backend convention.
