/**
 * #26 — the phone's route into the standup.
 *
 * Two separate silent failures are pinned here, because neither one throws and
 * neither one is visible in a green suite that only exercises services:
 *
 *  1. REGISTRATION. A tab id in App.jsx with no entry in SAIM_LITE_TABS makes
 *     notification routing fall through to Focus with no error. An id in
 *     SAIM_LITE_TABS with no tab in App.jsx sends a notification to a screen
 *     that does not exist. Both directions are asserted.
 *
 *  2. ORDERING. resolveSaimLitePlan checks the 'sheet' list BEFORE the 'tab'
 *     list, so adding 'standup' to SAIM_LITE_TABS while leaving it in the sheet
 *     branch is a no-op that looks like a completed change — the card keeps
 *     rendering and App never switches tabs. That branch also covers journal,
 *     meeting and brain, so this asserts those three are STILL sheets: the
 *     naive fix is to empty the branch and quietly change four other paths.
