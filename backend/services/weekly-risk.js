/**
 * Weekly Risk & Anomaly Summary — PIP competency 2 (proactive oversight).
 *
 * Nick sends this to Chris by midday every Monday; it is a standing 1:1 agenda
 * item and the evidence for proactive review of team activity with early
 * escalation. The first edition (w/c 11 Aug 2026) was assembled by hand from a
 * NOVA screen, which is fine once and untenable weekly — the failure mode of a
 * hand-built compliance report is that it silently stops being built.
 *
 * Split like pi-health and state-of-play: `snapshot()` reads, `assess()` judges,
 * `render()` writes the note. `assess()` is pure and takes a plain object, so
 * the anomaly rules — which are the actual product here, not the numbers — can
 * be pinned in a test with no NOVA, no vault and no clock.
 *
 * Two things the design refuses to do:
 *
 * 1. **It never invents the numbers it cannot reach.** Every source records
 *    whether it answered, and a section with no data says so rather than
 *    rendering as a healthy zero. A report that reads "0 breaches" because NOVA
 *    was down is worse than no report, because it is a false all-clear sent to
 *    the person assessing the PIP.
 *
 * 2. **It never asserts the manual sections on Nick's behalf.** Overtime,
 *    escalations-to-Chris, actions and data-quality judgements are his to state.
 *    They are stored per week and carried forward, and the report is BLOCKED
 *    from publishing while any required one is unanswered — the same shape as
 *    action-presenter's blockers: refuse and say why, rather than publish
 *    something that quietly reads as "nil" when it means "not asked".

// ── Task position ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * Open / overdue / closed-last-week, from the task store — SPLIT BY ORIGIN.
 *
 * ── Why the split ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This section used to count every open task together and lead on one overdue
 * number, and that number was misleading in the one direction that costs most.
 * The list holds two populations with nothing in common but a due date:
 *
 *   • COMMITMENTS — work somebody else asked for, or is waiting on. Missing one
 *     is a fact about Nick's reliability to other people, and it is what
 *     competencies 3 and 4 are actually measured on.
 *   • CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT — work Nick set himself to make the department
 *     better. Nobody is waiting. One slipping is a fact about his own ambition.
 *
 * Counting them together makes the improvement backlog PENALISE him: a man who
 * writes down thirty ideas and dates them optimistically reads, in a compliance
 * report, exactly like a man who has broken thirty promises. So **overdue counts
 * commitments only** (Nick, 1 Sep 2026), and the improvement figures are
 * reported beside it as what they are — work in hand, not a breach.
 *
 * ── The unclassified bucket is never folded away ────────────────────────────
 *
 * Most of the list has no classification, because nothing in the store records
 * who wanted the work (see shared/task-origin.cjs). Those rows are counted and
 * NAMED as their own third bucket. Folding them into improvement would hide a
 * broken promise from the report whose job is to surface them; folding them into
 * commitments would invent broken promises out of Nick's own ideas. An overdue
 * task nobody has classified is reported as exactly that — a number Nick has to
 * resolve before the headline figure means anything.
 *
 * "Closed last week" is the PREVIOUS Monday-to-Sunday, not a rolling 7 days: the
 * report is a weekly artefact with a fixed week boundary, and a rolling window
 * would quietly change what it counted depending on the hour it ran — the one
 * thing a figure sent to a manager must not do.
 *
 * `dropped` is counted separately from `done`. Both leave the open list, but
 * only one of them is work completed, and folding them together would let a
 * clear-out read as a productive week.

/**
 * Per-KPI week-on-week series from the trend rows. This is Chris's ask from the
 * 12 Aug 1:1 — a single week's snapshot cannot tell "bad" from "getting worse",
 * and the Tier 2 slide was only visible because Nick had hand-carried five
 * weeks of numbers into the first edition.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ THE TWO COLUMNS ARE CALENDAR WEEKS, NOT THE LAST TWO SAMPLES.
 *
 * It used to take `series[last]` and `series[last-1]`, which is wrong twice over
 * and was wrong in the live report on 14 Sep 2026.
 *
 * Wrong once because the report is built at 07:30 on a MONDAY, so the current
 * week's bucket held a single day — or nothing at all — and a one-day reading
 * was printed under "This week" against a full seven-day average. That is not a
 * like-for-like comparison and its delta is noise. The report's own task section
 * had this right all along: "Closed last week is the PREVIOUS Monday-to-Sunday,
 * not a rolling 7 days... the one thing a figure sent to a manager must not do."
 * The same document was using two definitions of its own reporting period.
 *
 * Wrong twice because a positional read CANNOT TELL A CURRENT SAMPLE FROM A
 * STALE ONE. 39 KPIs stopped landing on 5 Sep 2026 (weekday runs went 113 rows
 * to 74), and every one of them went on rendering its last surviving value under
 * the words "This week" — Tier 2's "44%, down 25.4" was w/c 1 Sep against w/c
 * 25 Aug, a fortnight old, with nothing on the page saying so. Ten of the
 * fourteen rows were in that state.
 *
 * So each row is now looked up BY WEEK. A KPI with no bucket in the reporting
 * week is `measured: false` and renders as not measured, which is a fact Chris
 * can act on; the alternative is a number that looks current and is not.
 *
 * `reportWeek` is the COMPLETED Monday-to-Sunday the report covers — the caller
 * passes `previousWeek(week)`, matching taskCounts exactly. Omitting it measures
 * nothing rather than silently falling back to the positional read, because that
 * fallback is the bug.
 */

 *   - Neither row carries a RAG. `days receiving a rating` has no 95% target to

 *
 * So this stores the exact body that was sent, alongside the assessed build it
 * came from, and build() hands that back verbatim while the week is locked.
 *
 * WARNING: recorded by the EXECUTOR, not by the screen. The send can be
 * approved from the weekly risk panel or from the Actions queue, and a hook on
 * one of them is a hook the other walks straight past -- the same reason the
 * task-blocks hold lives in task-store rather than in a route.
