/**
 * One row per day, from 1.1M raw samples.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `health_samples` is the right shape for a rolling HRV
 * baseline and the wrong shape for every other question anyone actually asks:
 * "was last night short", "how does this compare with a normal Tuesday", "has
 * resting heart rate been creeping up" all mean scanning a million rows. So
 * nothing outside the desktop HealthCard ever asked one. Two years of near-daily
 * sleep, HRV, resting heart rate, exercise and daylight sat in the database and
 * reached no surface Nick sees without going and looking for it.
 *
 * Split like `pi-health.assess()` / `state-of-play`: `buildDays()`,
 * `buildBaseline()` and `readiness()` are PURE — no DB, no clock, no network —
 * and hold every judgement worth arguing with. `sync()` does the I/O.
 *
 * ── Three things that are deliberate ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * MEDIANS, NOT MEANS, for HRV and resting heart rate. Both are noisy, and one
 * 12ms reading taken during a difficult call should not move the day. Same call
 * `stress-score` already makes, for the same reason.
 *
 * SLEEP IS KEYED ON THE NIGHT YOU WOKE ON, and that rule is not re-implemented
 * here — `apple-health.rollupSleepNights` owns it and this stores its answer.
 * Two places deciding which day a 01:30 sleep segment belongs to is how they
 * come to disagree.
 *
 * ⚠ THE SCALAR DAY KEY IS UTC, because `recorded_at` is stored UTC so that
 * string comparison is chronological comparison (health_samples' own rule). In
 * BST that puts a reading taken between midnight and 01:00 local on the previous
 * day. It is named rather than fixed: guessing a zone is how the calendar lost
 * an hour, and the effect here is a handful of steps on the wrong side of
 * midnight — not something to trade a silent timezone assumption for.

 * DAY if readings arrive at a steady rate — and heart rate does not. Measured on
 * 2025-01-05: 1,866 samples, of which 1,346 (72%) land in the two hours 11:00 to
 * 12:59 at 130-137bpm, against 16-21 an hour for the rest of the day. The watch
 * samples roughly 35x faster during a workout, so the plain median came back
 * 128bpm — a figure describing his exercise, presented as his day. It would move
 * whenever his training changed and stay flat through anything cardiovascular,
 * which is the exact opposite of what a trend chart is for.
 *
 * So each reading is weighted by the interval it stands for.
 *
 * ⚠ THE WEIGHT IS CAPPED, and the cap is measured rather than picked. Over
 * September 2026 the gap between consecutive samples is 209s at the median, 423s
 * at p90 and 807s at p99, with a maximum of 10,141s — a watch off the wrist for
 * nearly three hours. MAX_SAMPLE_WEIGHT_MS sits just above p99, so every genuine

/**
 * Re-roll a WIDE window by walking back in bounded chunks.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The hourly `sync()` re-reads 10 trailing days, which is right
 * for steady state — measured on the live table, no sample in the last week
 * arrived stamped more than 10 days earlier. But the worst arrival lag over the
 * last month is **730 days**, because the phone app backfills history forward
 * chronologically and has delivered two years of it in one go. A sample that
 * lands today stamped last March is invisible to the hourly rollup for ever:
 * `health_daily` would keep the row it computed when that day was empty.
 *
 * ⚠ Chunked, and NOT optional. `sync()` pulls HRV and resting heart rate as raw
 * rows so the daily figure can be a median, capped at 20,000 — so a single wide
 * call silently keeps the newest rows and rolls up a partial history. That is
 * the bug this module already shipped once (744 days written, 328 with any HRV),
 * and the chunking is the reason the backfill script does not hit it.
 *
 * Lives here rather than in the script so the scheduler and the script share one
 * implementation — the alternative is chunking logic in a script the nightly job
 * cannot reuse, which is how the two come to disagree.
