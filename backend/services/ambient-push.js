/**
 * When an ambient observation is worth interrupting for.
 *
 * ── The correction that produced this file ───────────────────────────────────
 * I said water should never push. Nick, 31 Aug 2026: *"if I'm sat in the office,
 * and haven't recorded a drink in hours, that should be called out — if I'm in a
 * meeting, or hiking, then not. But yes — I think it all should push, but
 * contextually and sensitively."*
 *
 * He is right and the reasoning I had was lazy. Whether something is worth
 * saying is not a property of the SIGNAL, it is a property of the MOMENT. The
 * same fact — no drink logged for three hours — is worth a word at a desk and is
 * noise halfway up a hill. Deciding per signal is how you end up with a system
 * that is either mute or a pest, because there is no single answer to "should
 * water push" and I was trying to give one.
 *
 * ⚠ Note "hiking" needs no special case, and that is the test of the design: if
 * he is walking, `atDesk` is already false and the steps are climbing. A moment
 * described honestly out of the signals SAiM already has does not need a list of
 * activities to exclude.
 *
 * ── What this file does NOT do ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It does not send. `webpush.sendToAll` already carries the machinery that stops
 * a nag becoming a pest, and every one of those was built for a reason:
 *
 *   · `attention-lifecycle` gives the thing a DURABLE IDENTITY, so the same
 *     observation cannot notify twice across widget, push, kiosk and phone, and
 *     an acknowledged one stays visible without ever interrupting again.
 *   · the governor holds quiet hours, a 30-minute dedupe and an hourly cap.
 *
 * So this decides ONLY "is now the moment", and hands the survivors over. A
 * second copy of quiet hours here is how two parts of a system come to disagree
 * about the same evening.
 *
 * PURE where it judges: `momentFrom()` and `worthInterrupting()` take plain data
 * and a clock. Only `deliver()` sends.
 *
 * CommonJS — NEURO backend convention.
