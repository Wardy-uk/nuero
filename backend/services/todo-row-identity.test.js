/**
 * Two bugs that made a task row's controls look broken, and neither threw.
 *
 * ── 1. A row's identity was its POSITION ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `/api/todos` assigns `id: i + 1` over the parsed list, and `listTaskRows`
 * orders by due date with the undated last. So setting a due date moved that
 * row up the ordering, shifted every index below it, and any key built from
 * `id` then named a DIFFERENT task. The expanded row collapsed, or a neighbour
 * opened instead — indistinguishable from the control not working, which is
 * exactly how it was reported: "I can't edit the due date for some tasks".
 *
 * It applied to every control on the row. The date one is simply the one that
 * moves the row it lives on, so it is where the breakage always showed.
 *
 * ── 2. The date picker wrote on every keystroke ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * `<input type="date">` reports an empty value while it is partially typed, so
 * patching straight from onChange fired `due_date: null` before the month had
 * been entered — a write and a full refetch per keystroke, each one re-sorting
 * the list underneath the person typing.
 *
 * ⚠ A SOURCE SCAN, so it pins the shape rather than the runtime behaviour: what
 * it catches is somebody reintroducing the positional key or the direct patch.
 * The positive control is what stops a broken scan passing by finding nothing.
