/**
 * Ambient observations — what SARA can notice about Nick's body and his day.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Nick, 31 Aug 2026: she should behave like J.A.R.V.I.S. — sat down at home on a
 * weekend, suggest getting up; a health metric worth noting, tell him; not eaten
 * in a while, suggest lunch; not exercised, poke him for a walk.
 *
 * The brain for that already existed. `context-state` resolves nine situational
 * states and `attention.gate()` decides what is worth surfacing. What was
 * missing was inputs — and, measured on 31 Aug, most of the inputs were already
 * in the house:
 *
 *   · the HA Companion app had been reporting `activity` (the CoreMotion
 *     Still / Walking / Running / Automotive classification), steps, floors and
 *     Focus mode all along — NEURO was reading the wrong entity ids for five
 *     weeks and blamed the phone for going quiet.
 *   · `health_daily` holds 743 complete days; `health-signals` already computes
 *     RHR / HRV / wrist-temp / sleep-debt trends AND NOTHING CONSUMED THEM.
 *   · dietary energy and water are ALREADY in `health_samples` — MyFitnessPal
 *     writes to Apple Health and NEURO already ingests Apple Health. No API
 *     integration was ever needed.
 *
 * ── What this is NOT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ⚠ It adds no candidates to `decision-engine` and re-ranks nothing. It produces
 * OBSERVATIONS — things that are true about right now — and hands them over.
 * `decision-engine` stays the one place something becomes worth surfacing and
 * `attention.gate()` the one place it is filtered, exactly as `attention.js`
 * says. This is a sensor, not a second brain; `sara/backend/state/inference.js`
 * was retired for being the latter.
 *
 * ⚠ NOTHING HERE NOTIFIES. Pull only, first release. Six new interruption
 * sources is precisely how SARA becomes a pest and gets muted, after which none
 * of the rest matters — nudge volume is the one budget allowed to argue against
 * building more. Earn the push once the observations have been read for a while
 * and found to be right.
 *
 * ── The rule the whole file turns on ────────────────────────────────────────
 * ⚠ **NOT LOGGED IS NOT NOT DONE.** This is the difference between a useful
 * observation and a daily lie. `dietary_energy_consumed` last has a sample on
 * 30 Mar 2026 and `dietary_water` on 3 Feb 2025 — so "no food logged today" is
 * true every single day, and a naive read would tell Nick he has not eaten every
 * lunchtime for five months. The signal is only meaningful when he is ACTUALLY
 * LOGGING, so each diet observation first asks whether the habit is live
 * (`LOGGING_DAYS_REQUIRED` of the trailing window) and reports `unknown` with
 * the reason when it is not. Same species as "an unread domain is structurally
 * empty and null, never 0", applied to a habit rather than a feed.
 *
 * The same rule, differently dressed, is why a sedentary read needs
 * `lastReportAt`: a phone that is switched off and a phone reporting `Still`
 * look identical if you only read the value.
 *
 * PURE where it judges. `assess()` takes plain data and a clock and returns the
 * observations, so every threshold and every refusal pins without a database,
 * a phone or a network — the `pi-health.assess()` / `state-of-play.assess()`
 * split. Only `build()` reads.
 *
 * CommonJS — NEURO backend convention.

// `apple_stand_time` IS the accelerometer-derived answer to the question that

// Shape, measured: HOURLY buckets, value = minutes stood in that hour, and an
// hour with no standing has NO ROW AT ALL. ⚠ That absence is the trap — it means

// 13-19 samples an hour, continuously, including all night (he sleeps in the

// WITH heart rate in it is a real hour of sitting; a missing stand hour with no
// heart rate is a watch that was off, and is unknown rather than sedentary.
//
// This outranks the phone's `activity` for one plain reason: the watch is on his
// body and the phone might be on a desk in another room. Live proof on the day
