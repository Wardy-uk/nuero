/**
 * Apple Calendar and Reminders, pushed from the phone.
 *
 * ── Why push, and why Scriptable ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * NEURO cannot reach into iCloud. There is no server-side API worth having:
 * CalDAV against iCloud needs an app-specific password and is undocumented and
 * flaky, EventKit needs a Mac and Nick is on Windows, and Reminders has no web
 * API at all. So the phone pushes.
 *
 * Scriptable is the vehicle because it is already on his phone, already trusted,
 * already holds the NEURO API token in the Keychain for the widget, and has
 * native `Reminder` and `CalendarEvent` classes. A scheduled Shortcut runs it.
 * Nothing leaves the tailnet and no third party is involved.
 *
 * ⚠ Scriptable has NO HealthKit API — checked against its docs, not assumed.
 * Health is not and cannot be part of this; it already arrives via the FreeReps
 * app on /api/v1/ingest, and the route for moving off that would be Shortcuts'
 * "Find Health Samples", not this file.
 *
 * ── The calendar is the point ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Until now NEURO could only see the WORK diary, so every "is Nick free"
 * answer — time-fit, the day planner, 1-2-1 booking, context-state — was wrong
 * outside working hours and blind to anything personal inside them. Apple events
 * land in the SAME `calendar_cache` as Graph events, with a `source` column,
 * precisely so all of those keep asking one question of one table.
 *
 * ⚠ That column is load-bearing for deletes. calendar-sync is replace-by-window
 * and runs every few minutes; it used to empty the whole table, which would have
 * wiped every Apple event minutes after it arrived, silently. See
 * db.clearCalendarCache.
 *
 * ── Reminders are one-way, and that is safe ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A reminder becomes a task. Completing that task does NOT complete the
 * reminder — NEURO cannot write to iCloud — so the reminder keeps being pushed.
 * That would be a resurrection loop except for one property of task-store:
 * `createTask` folds on dedupe_key into the existing row WHATEVER its status,
 * and the fold never touches status. So a re-pushed completed reminder folds
 * into the done task and stays done. Verified, not assumed, and pinned.
 *
 * Known limitation, stated rather than hidden: identity is the task TEXT, not
 * Apple's identifier, so renaming a reminder creates a second task. That is a
 * visible, droppable annoyance rather than a silent failure, and it is how every
 * other capture route in NEURO already behaves. An `external_id` column would
 * fix it and is deliberately not built until something needs it.
