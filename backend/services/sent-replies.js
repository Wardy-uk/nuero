/**
 * Replies Nick has sent from triage (#69).
 *
 * A sent reply used to leave NO trace inside NEURO. The send path called
 * `dismissEmail(emailId, 'replied')` and that was the entire record — the only
 * evidence it had happened lived in Outlook's Sent Items. So "I answered that
 * on Tuesday" was not answerable from NEURO at all, and outbound mail was the
 * newest write path in the system and the least observable.
 *
 * This is deliberately the ONE-ROW version, chosen over feeding the body to the
 * meeting-note extraction. It records what happened and nothing more: no AI
 * call, no commitment parsing, nothing to tune. That richer version now has
 * something to be built ON, which it did not before — the same order #88/#89
 * followed, where real durations were recorded and deliberately not consumed
 * until there was a body of them to calibrate against.
 *
 * The one judgement here is `recipientsSource`. On a plain reply / replyAll,
 * **Graph** decides who the message goes to, not NEURO — the route only knows
 * the addressees for certain when the composer passed an explicit `to`. So the
 * list is stored with its provenance rather than as fact: `explicit` is what
 * was actually addressed, `inferred` is NEURO's reading of the thread, and
 * `unknown` is neither. Following #65, a record that cannot tell those apart is
 * worse than one that admits the gap — an inferred recipient list presented as
 * fact is exactly how "who did I copy?" gets answered wrongly.
