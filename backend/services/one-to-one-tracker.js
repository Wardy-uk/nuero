/**
 * `Areas/1-2-1 Tracker.md` — generated, not hand-maintained (#31).
 *
 * The tracker called itself "single source of truth for 1-2-1 cadence" and
 * "read by Morning Standup". Both were false: nothing in NEURO has ever parsed
 * it, and it had been frozen since `last-reviewed: 2026-04-02` — every Next Due
 * four months past, and still listing Arman (left the business) and Willem
 * (moved teams). Its disagreement with the People notes is what started the
 * 14 Aug audit in the first place.
 *
 * `one-to-one-detect` now derives the dates from the meeting notes, so the
 * table is rendered from that rather than typed. Leaving a hand-maintained copy
 * alive beside a derived one is how the original problem happened.
 *
 * Three rules, all borrowed from things this repo already learned:
 *
 *  - SURGICAL, between markers, like vault-hygiene's `<!-- ctx-links -->`. Only
 *    the table is generated. Cadence Rules, the Status Key, "How to use this",
 *    Open Actions and Related are Nick's editorial and are never touched —
 *    same rule as `feature-tracker` never reordering the ranked sections.
 *  - It renders only what NEURO can KNOW. The old table had "Invite Sent?" and
 *    "PeopleHR Updated?" columns; NEURO has no view of either, and generating
 *    them as ❌ would state a fact it has not checked. They are dropped, and the
 *    file says so rather than quietly losing them.
 *  - DRY-RUN BY DEFAULT, backing up every touched file, like every other
 *    mutating vault path here.
 *
 * `buildTable` is pure and takes plain objects, so the rendering is testable
 * without a vault — the same split as `pi-health.assess()` and `cadenceState()`.
