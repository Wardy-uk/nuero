// --- Which entities are actually the phone? -------------------------------
//
// ⚠ The Companion app did NOT stop reporting (31 Aug 2026). It re-registered,
// HA created a SECOND set of entities, and Home Assistant disambiguated them by
// appending `_2` to the ENTITY ID — not to the device prefix:
//
//     sensor.nicks_iphone_battery_level    ->  sensor.nicks_iphone_battery_level_2
//     sensor.nicks_iphone_activity         ->  sensor.nicks_iphone_activity_2
//     device_tracker.nicks_iphone          ->  device_tracker.nicks_iphone_2
//
// Measured live: of everything matching `nicks_iphone`, exactly TWO entities
// carry no suffix and both are `unavailable` camera entities, while 28 suffixed
// ones update normally. So the entities this file asked for did not merely hold
// stale values, they did not EXIST — every read returned null for five weeks
// while the data sat in HA, and the comment above `pickUpdatedAt` blamed the
// phone. That staleness detection is GOOD and stays: it was right that the old
// entities were frozen and wrong about why.
//
// ⚠ Note `device_tracker.nicks_iphone_2` — for the tracker, whose entity id IS
// the device name, the suffix looks exactly like a longer prefix. That is what
// makes "just set HA_PHONE_PREFIX=nicks_iphone_2" so tempting, and it is wrong:
// it resolves the tracker and breaks every sensor, because those want
// `sensor.nicks_iphone_battery_level_2`, not `sensor.nicks_iphone_2_battery_level`.
// The Pi's .env had been set that way, which is why presence still answered
// while battery, wifi and location stayed null.
//
// So what is resolved is a SUFFIX, decided once from the battery anchor and
// applied to every entity — resolving per sensor would let two registrations
// mix on one payload. Discovery rather than a hardcoded `_2`, because the next
// re-registration would break it again and would do so just as silently.

// Every entity id that belongs to THIS phone, so `phoneEntity` can resolve the
// suffix PER KEY rather than assuming one holds device-wide. Scoped to the base
// deliberately: a set carrying every entity in HA would pull other people's
// devices into this object, which is both wrong and noisy to log.
