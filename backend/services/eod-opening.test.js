/**
 * SAiM opens the End of Day.
 *
 * The old notification was an instruction — "End of day. Before you close the
 * laptop: one win, one thing that didn't go to plan... Standup tab → EOD." That
 * tells him a ritual is due; it is not SAiM saying anything. Now the session is
 * started server-side first so her actual opening line exists BEFORE the
 * notification does, and that line is what he reads.
 *
 * The two pure halves are pinned here. The delivery path is covered by the
 * fallback test at the bottom, which is the one that matters most: a clever
 * opener is never worth losing the prompt over.
