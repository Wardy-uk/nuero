/**
 * Completions Microsoft would not take, held until it will.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `POST /api/todos/complete-ms` flips the vault mirror first (instant feedback,
 * the same order as `wip-ms`), then pushes to Graph. When Graph refused it fell
 * back to the Power Automate webhook, and when that was unset or failed it
 * returned `{ok: true, pushed: 'none'}` with a warning string — and that was the
 * end of it. Nothing retried.
 *
 * ⚠ And the completion did not merely fail to reach Microsoft: it UNDID itself.
 * `Tasks/Microsoft Tasks.md` is regenerated wholesale from Graph every 30
 * minutes on weekdays, so a task Nick ticked reappeared as open inside half an
 * hour, with no warning still on screen and nothing anywhere recording that he
 * had already dealt with it. The single most demoralising possible shape: work
 * done, silently reverted, and offered back as if it had never happened.
 *
 * Graph auth expiring is not a rare event here — the device code flow needs
 * re-running periodically and `getAccessToken()` returns null for the whole
 * window in between. That is precisely when this matters.
 *
 * ── The rules ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. NOTHING IS EVER SILENTLY DROPPED. An item that exhausts its attempts
 *    becomes `failed` with its last reason, stays on the queue and is reported.
 *    Deleting it would recreate the original bug with extra steps.
 *
 * 2. ALMOST NOTHING IS TERMINAL. The obvious classification — retry `auth`,
 *    give up on `not_found` — is wrong here, and the reason is in
 *    `setPlannerPercent`: it returns `not_found` when it cannot read the task's
 *    etag, and `graphFetch` returns null on a 401. So during an auth outage a
 *    perfectly real Planner task reports `not_found`. Only `no_task_id` is
 *    genuinely terminal, because there is nothing to retry. Everything else is
 *    bounded by attempts and age instead, which fails towards trying again.
 *
 * 3. THE MIRROR MUST NOT OFFER THE TASK BACK while a completion is pending.
 *    `syncMicrosoftTasks` asks `pendingIds()` and skips those lines. This is the
 *    load-bearing half — without it the retry works and Nick still sees the task
 *    reappear, ticks it again, and queues a second copy of the same completion.
 *    Suppression ends the moment the item leaves `pending`, so a permanently
 *    failed push gives the task BACK rather than hiding it for ever. Hiding work
 *    on a bad guess is the failure that would end the feature.
 *
 * 4. IDEMPOTENT BY msId. Ticking the same task twice is one queue entry, and a
 *    retry against a task Microsoft has already completed is a no-op there.
 *
 * State lives in `agent_state` (KV), following standup-session, focus-session
 * and one_two_one_moves: the volume is failed pushes only, and a schema
 * migration on the live DB is a bigger risk than the query convenience is worth.
 * It MUST be persisted — the backend restarts several times a day on deploys,
 * and an in-memory queue would lose exactly the completions it exists to hold.
