/**
 * Task blocks — a NEURO task pushed into the O365 calendar, and the write-up
 * that decides when it is actually finished (18 Aug 2026).
 *
 * Two halves, and the second is the point.
 *
 * **Pushing the task out.** `tasks` already knows how long a thing takes
 * (`estimate_minutes`, #87) and `calendar_cache` already knows where the diary
 * is empty. Nothing joined them, so "block an hour for this" was a manual copy
 * between two systems NEURO owns both ends of. `schedule()` creates the event
 * on Nick's own calendar with NO attendees, which is why it can run on a plain
 * confirm rather than through the queued/approve gate that `schedule_focus_block`
 * uses in chat: a solo block emails nobody, so there is nothing to un-send.
 *
 * **Deciding when it is done.** Yesterday's rule, from `meeting-notes-source`:
 * *a meeting in the diary does not mean Nick attended it* — the Plaud note is
 * what proves both that he was there and that the meeting was processed. A time
 * block has the identical hole and no recording to close it, because nobody
 * Plauds a solo work block. So the evidence is an outcome note Nick writes, and
 * until one lands the task **holds at `awaiting-writeup` rather than going
 * done** (Nick's call, 18 Aug). That hold is enforced in `task-store.updateTask`,
 * the single writer, so it cannot be walked around by the SARA completion
 * funnel, the MCP tool, the chat tool or the route.
 *
 * Three refusals carry the design:
 *
 * 1. **An empty stub does not release the task.** NEURO writes the note, so a
 *    detector that only checks the file EXISTS would create the evidence for its
 *    own test and mark the work done with nothing in it — the feature failing in
 *    the exact silent way it exists to prevent. `isOutcomeWritten()` strips the
 *    template it wrote and requires real prose underneath.
 *
 * 2. **The hold is always escapable, and the escape is recorded.** Plans change,
 *    blocks get abandoned, some work genuinely has no outcome worth writing up.
 *    A hold with no way out would wedge a task in Nick's list forever, and the
 *    first time that happened he would stop using the feature. `release()` takes
 *    a REASON and stores it — a `released` block is a decision on the record,
 *    deliberately distinct from a `complete` one that earned its note.
 *
 * 3. **Nothing rescans the calendar.** Idempotency is the unique (task, day,
 *    start) index plus the block rows, never a sweep of Outlook — deleting the
 *    block in Outlook is a decision, and a scan would recreate it forever with
 *    no way to refuse. That is `plaud-admin-blocks`'s ledger lesson, unchanged.

 * re-selections in a picker to add a fifth, and his difficulty is INITIATION:
 * a five-step way to add one task to a block is a task that never gets blocked.
 *
 * ── The window grows, and only as far as the diary allows ───────────────────
 *
 * Adding work to a fixed window is only overpacking it silently, so the block is
 * EXTENDED by what the task is thought to take. But a real event in a real
 * calendar cannot be lengthened over the top of the next meeting, so the new end
 * is capped by `latestEndFor` and any shortfall is REPORTED rather than either
 * refused or quietly swallowed — a deliberately tight window is Nick's call to
 * make (`plan`'s rule); a double-booked one is not his call at all.
 *
 * ⚠ An unreadable diary extends NOTHING. The task is still added, because
 * membership takes nobody else's time; only the extension needs to know what is
 * around it.
 *
 * ── What it refuses ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠ A block that has already PASSED. Putting a task into a window that has gone
 * is a claim it was worked on then, which is precisely the evidence the write-up
 * hold exists to demand. `reschedule` is the way to move a missed block.
 *
 * ⚠ A task already in ANOTHER open block. Two live blocks holding one task means
 * two holds, two outcome notes, and a sweep with no way to say which sitting the
 * evidence belongs to — `reschedule`'s membership rule, stated as a refusal
 * rather than discovered as a bug.

/**
 * The window came and went and the work did not happen. Move it.
 *
 * ── Why this is not just "drop it and block it again" ────────────────────────
 *
 * That is what Nick had to do, and it costs the two things the feature exists
 * to protect. Dropping loses the membership — a nine-task block is nine
 * re-selections in a picker — and it leaves the ticks behind, so anything he
 * DID get through in that window either has to be re-ticked on a new block
 * (which is a lie about when it happened) or silently falls out of the wins
 * ledger. His difficulty is initiation; a six-step recovery from a missed block
 * is a block that never gets rebooked.
 *
 * ── The rule that shapes it: a tick is finished work ────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠ TICKED ITEMS DO NOT MOVE. They are done, and they are held only until the
 * outcome note is written — carrying them into a future slot would put finished
 * work back in the diary and make the new block's note responsible for evidence
 * about a sitting that already happened. So the old block survives whenever
 * anything in it was ticked, still `awaiting-writeup`, still owed its note, and
 * only the un-ticked half moves.
 *
 * The old block's calendar event is therefore deleted ONLY when nothing was
 * ticked — an empty block in a past hour is clutter, but a block that produced
 * real work is a record of where the time went.
 *
 * ── Order is load-bearing ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠ The new block is created FIRST. If the slot is taken, the diary cannot be
 * read or Graph refuses, nothing has been touched and the old block is exactly
 * as it was — whereas detaching first and then failing would leave the tasks in
 * no block at all, which is the one outcome worse than a missed window.

 * NOTHING connected them. So Nick blocked an hour for weekly-risk prep, arrived
 * at it, and NEURO had no idea the two were related — he went looking for a
 * session that had never been started and reasonably concluded one was lost.
 * The block knew which tasks and when; the session knew how to be started; no
 * code joined them up.
 *
 * ── The rules ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. IT PROPOSES, NEVER STARTS. Auto-starting a session would assert that Nick
 *    is working on something because a calendar said he would be — inventing
 *    the one number the whole feature rests on. `task-blocks` is a detector and
 *    stays one.
 *
 * 2. ONE THING AT A TIME. A block holds up to twelve tasks; a session is one
 *    thing. So the block is not "startable" — each of its tasks is, and the
 *    card offers them individually. Folding a four-task block into one session
 *    would make `text` a lie and the close-out meaningless.
 *
 * 3. ONLY A `scheduled` BLOCK. `awaiting-writeup` means it has been worked and
 *    owes a note; `released`, `complete` and `dropped` are over. Offering to
 *    start work in a window that has already been accounted for would reopen a
 *    thing Nick has closed.
 *
 * 4. A TICKED TASK IS NOT OFFERED. `awaiting` means he has already finished it
 *    and it is waiting on the write-up, so proposing a session on it would ask
 *    him to do it twice.
 *
 * 5. A SESSION ALREADY RUNNING ON ONE OF THEM IS REPORTED, NOT RE-OFFERED —
 *    the same rule the attention card now follows, and for the same reason:
 *    starting it again force-switches, which is how a session gets replaced.
 *
 * 6. A PAST WINDOW IS NOT THIS. Once `passed`, the block owes a write-up and
 *    belongs to the sweep's prompt. Two cards asking different things about one
 *    block is how both get ignored.
