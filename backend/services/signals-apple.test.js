/**
 * The Apple Reminders row on "Her senses" (item 19).
 *
 * It is a PUSH source with no server-side schedule: nothing runs on a timer, so
 * when the Shortcut on the phone stops firing there is no failed job, no error
 * and no empty result anywhere. A phone that has stopped pushing looks exactly
 * like a man with no reminders. Measured 3 Sep 2026 — last push 29 August, 111
 * hours earlier, one task ever created from it, and nothing in NEURO said so.
 *
 * What is pinned is that the three answers stay apart: never pushed, pushing,
 * and stopped.
