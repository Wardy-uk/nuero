/**
 * Renders the outcomes rollup as the weekly review's "did this help?" section.
 *
 * Split from outcomes.js on purpose: that module reports movement and does not
 * editorialise, because the same numbers are read by a UI that will want to
 * present them differently. The interpretation — which direction is good, and
 * what a change is worth saying out loud — lives here.
 *
 * The tone rule is the same one the nudges follow: state the fact, name what it
 * suggests, never imply a verdict about Nick. "Snoozes up 40%" is useful. "You
 * ignored SAiM 40% more this week" is the sentence that gets the review closed.
