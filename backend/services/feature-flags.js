// Feature switches that are Nick's decision, settable in Settings.
//
// Every one of these was `process.env.X === 'true'` captured into a module-level
// const at require time, so changing his mind meant an SSH session, an .env edit
// and a pm2 restart. Two of them — the day planner and its health rule — are
// recorded in CLAUDE.md as HIS calls, which made them exactly the wrong things
// to bury behind six steps of friction on a system whose stated premise is that
// his bottleneck is initiation.
//
// Same shape as `notion-sync` and the OpenRouter key before it: the value lives
// in `agent_state`, the environment still WINS where explicitly set, and it is
// read at CALL time so a toggle takes effect immediately.
//
// ⚠ Read at call time is the load-bearing half. A module-level const captured at
// require time is why the .env edit needed a restart in the first place; moving
// the value to the DB without moving the READ would have changed nothing.

 * ⚠ The two default polarities are NOT cosmetic and must be preserved exactly.
 *
 *   default false — the switch must be turned ON deliberately, because the thing
 *     it enables writes to the outside world or acts on Nick's behalf.
 *   default true  — the switch is a KILL SWITCH for behaviour that is already
 *     live and wanted; flipping the default would silently disable a working
 *     feature the moment this file shipped.
