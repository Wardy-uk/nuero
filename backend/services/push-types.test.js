 * briefing.js sends `meeting_alert` (listed); meeting-prep.js sends
 * `meeting_prep` (not listed) — so the "Meeting in 25 min" alert carrying the
 * prep notes was suppressible, and the live pm2 log shows the hourly cap
 * swallowing seven real 1-2-1 reminders. webpush.test.js was green throughout
 * because it asserted the bypass using `meeting_alert`, a string that code path
 * never sends. A test over an invented name proves nothing about the real one.
 *
 * So this reads the SOURCE, the way action-presenter.test.js parses
 * executeAction's case labels: adding a sendToAll with a new type fails here
 * until someone classifies it, rather than surfacing months later as a nudge
 * that quietly never arrives.
