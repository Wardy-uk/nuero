/**
 * Wins — the derived ledger of finished work.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Measured on the live DB before a line was written. Over thirty days NEURO
 * recorded FOUR completions. In the same window: 271 commits, 57 executed SARA
 * actions, a full diary, 2,229 vault writes. The `Momentum` card on the Today
 * tab — `doneToday`, `streakDays`, the seven-day sparkline, "Done today" — was
 * opened NINE times and showed 0, no streak, and "Nothing logged yet" on every
 * one of them.
 *
 * The reward surface was not missing. It was starved, and it was starved for
 * one reason: the only thing feeding it was self-report. A tickbox. And a
 * tickbox is precisely the thing that stops happening on the days it matters.
 *
 * So a win is DETECTED, not declared — the rule the rest of the system already
 * follows everywhere else. Who reports to Nick is READ, not typed. 1-2-1s are
 * detected, not declared. The 1-2-1 tracker is generated. This ledger was the
 * last hand-typed thing in NEURO, and it was the one where hand-typing hurt
 * most, because the cost of the gap was not a wrong number on a report — it
 * was NEURO telling Nick he had finished four things in a month he shipped 271
 * commits in.
 *
 * ── The three refusals ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. A FAILED SOURCE IS A GAP, NEVER A ZERO. `collect()` returns `gaps`, and a
 *    source that could not be read is named. This is weekly-risk's rule and it
 *    is load-bearing here specifically: the bug being fixed IS a wins count
 *    that read zero while the work was happening. A feed that silently reads 0
 *    when git is unreachable reproduces it exactly.
 *
 * 2. NO POINTS, NO SCORE. A count of finished things, each with evidence. A
 *    weighted score is a claim that a commit and a 1-2-1 are commensurable,
 *    which is false, and it is gameable by the one person it is meant to
 *    serve. The number has exactly one job: to be TRUE.
 *
 * 3. EVERY ROW NAMES ITS EVIDENCE. A commit sha, a sara_action id, an
 *    activity_log id. A win without evidence is an assertion, and an assertion
 *    is what the tickbox already was. `manual` is the single source allowed a
 *    null, because "I had a hard conversation" has no artefact and excluding
 *    it would be its own kind of dishonesty.
 *
 * ── Deliberately NOT sourced ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * MEETINGS WERE excluded here, on a reason that was wrong, and the correction
 * is worth keeping. The claim was that `calendar_cache` has no attendees column
 * so `attendeesOther()` "cannot reach" the data. But plaud-admin-blocks does not
 * read that table — `calendar-sync` hands it freshly fetched Graph events which
 * carry attendees, isOrganizer and responseStatus. The filter was already
 * running against exactly the right data, weekly, already measured on 96 real
 * events. So the LARGEST category of finished work in the week was dropped, and
 * the ledger read 17/week against a much bigger real week: true, and small
 * enough to read as "you did almost nothing" — which is the same uselessness as
 * the tickbox, just better sourced. And then wrong AGAIN in the other direction: the first fix counted every accepted, finished, multi-person event — but a meeting in the diary does not mean Nick attended it. What proves attendance AND that the meeting was processed is the Plaud note, so the source reads notes now. See services/meeting-notes-source.js.
 *
 * Still not sourced, each for a stated reason (see KNOWN_GAPS): Jira
 * resolutions, emails merely dismissed, and vault writes — 2,229 in thirty
 * days, overwhelmingly Syncthing and the import pipeline rather than Nick, with
 * no signal in the row separating the two.

/**
 * A typical working day, as the MEDIAN of recent ones. Null until there is
 * enough history to mean anything.
 *
 * This replaced the streak, and the reason is worth keeping. The streak counted
 * consecutive days with any win — fine when the ledger only knew about ticked
 * tasks, and worthless the moment meetings were counted honestly: it jumped
 * from 4 to 35 and became effectively unbreakable, because Nick has a meeting
 * or a commit nearly every working day. A number that cannot go down is not a
 * signal, and it is exactly the kind of number NEURO already has too many of.
 *
 * A median gives the card the one thing a bare count lacks: something to be
 * compared WITH. And the comparison is Nick against his own normal, never
 * against zero or against anyone else.
 *
 * Median, not mean — one 13-win Monday would drag a mean up and make every
 * ordinary day read as a failure. Weekends are excluded (a quiet Sunday is not
 * a bad day) and so is today, which is still in progress and would otherwise
 * compare itself against itself.
 *
 * Pure: takes day counts and an anchor, touches no DB and no clock. Returns
 * null below MIN_DAYS rather than a number built on three data points — the
 * same refusal stress-score makes when it reports `calibrating`.

 * The counters. Today, this week, all time, streak, seven-day shape.

 * ⚠ "This week" is the CALENDAR week — Monday to today — and it resets on a
 * Monday morning. It was a rolling seven days until 31 Aug 2026, which is a
 * perfectly good window and the wrong words for it: the widget said "64
 * finished this week" on a Monday morning that had barely started, because the
 * count still reached back into the week before. A number labelled "this week"
 * that never resets is one nobody can act on. The Monday boundary is
 * `weekly-target.weekStart`, not a second copy of it, so the ring and this
 * count cannot disagree about which week it is (the ring counts `task_done`
 * only; this counts everything finished — different numbers, same week).
 *
 * `doneLast7` keeps the rolling window for anything that genuinely wants a
 * trailing read, and `last7`/`best7` stay rolling because the sparkline is
 * explicitly a seven-day SHAPE, not a week.
 *
 * `total` is the one that only ever goes up, and that is the point of it: every
 * other growing number in NEURO is a debt — 159 open tasks, 287 waiting-on,
 * a pending actions queue. This is the first counter where growth is good news.
