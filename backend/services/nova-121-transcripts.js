/**
 * 1-2-1 transcripts, offered to NOVA.
 *
 * NOVA used to read Plaud itself over MCP. That connection has never been authorised in
 * prod — `plaud_oauth_tokens` unset, transport closing on a loop — so not one 1-2-1 has
 * ever had a recording attached. NEURO's plaud-sync, meanwhile, has been landing every
 * note in the vault reliably for months, with `plaud_id`, the date and the `people:`
 * links in frontmatter. So NEURO is the Plaud route now, and NOVA gets the transcript
 * over the bridge keyed on that same `plaud_id`.
 *
 * ⚠ IT OFFERS. IT DOES NOT ATTACH.
 *
 * Attribution is a guess and must be treated as one. Plaud names recordings by timestamp,
 * so the title rarely says whose 1-2-1 it was; a note that mentions three people says
 * nothing about which of them it was *with*; and Plaud has previously filed a 1-2-1
 * against Nick with the other person logged as "Unknown Speaker 1" (see Nathan's holding
 * note). Binding the wrong transcript writes one person's conversation onto another
 * person's permanent record, and NOVA's extractor would then close THAT person's actions
 * from words they never said. So every candidate goes to NOVA as a proposal, carrying HOW
 * it was attributed, and a human approves it there.
 *
 * Read-only against the vault.

 * One-off: send NOVA the repaired transcript for every recording it has APPROVED.
 *
 * The 2026-10-08 Plaud paging bug wrote long transcripts as their first ~50 utterances
 * repeated, and 18 approved 1-2-1s / conversations in NOVA hold that text. `offerTranscripts`
 * skips anything NOVA has resolved (correctly — re-offering would re-ask Nick), and NOVA's
 * candidate route ignores a resolved recording, so they could never be refreshed.
 *
 * Pending candidates need nothing: the normal sweep re-pushes them from the vault and NOVA
 * updates a pending row. Rejected ones are not 1-2-1s and are never read, so they are left.
 *
 * Dry run by default. A transcript that STILL repeats in the vault (not yet repaired) is
 * never sent. NOVA re-checks that the new text completes what it holds, so a mismatch is
 * refused there too.
