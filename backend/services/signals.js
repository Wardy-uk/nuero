/**
 * Every sense SARA has, and whether it is actually working.
 *
 * Nick, 31 Aug 2026: *"we should add something in NEURO … that shows all these
 * signals, and whether they are red or green."*
 *
 * The argument for it is this session's own history. Three separate blindnesses
 * were found in a single morning, and **every one of them was invisible**:
 *
 *   · the HA phone feed had returned null for five weeks after the phone
 *     re-registered, and the code blamed the phone for going quiet.
 *   · `health-signals` had been computing trends nothing ever read.
 *   · dietary logging stopped in March 2026 and nothing noticed, because a
 *     metric with no recent rows returns an empty result rather than an error.
 *
 * A dead sensor and a quiet one look identical from every screen in the system.
 * That is the failure this page exists to make impossible, and it is why the
 * states below are FIVE and not two.
 *
 * ── The states ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   live            reporting inside its own expected cadence
 *   stale           it used to report and has stopped — the loud one
 *   never           configured but has never said anything
 *   off             not configured, which is a CHOICE and not a fault
 *   error           the check itself failed; we do not know
 *
 * ⚠ `off` and `stale` must never render the same. Not having a desktop agent
 * installed is a decision; having one that stopped talking is a problem. Two
 * states that look alike is how a real fault hides behind a deliberate gap.
 *
 * ⚠ Each signal carries its OWN cadence. Heart rate arrives every few minutes,
 * body weight every few days, and a shared threshold would either scream about
 * the scales or stay silent about the watch — the `health-signals.sensorsQuiet`
 * lesson, applied to sources rather than metrics.
 *
 * PURE where it judges: `rate()` takes a timestamp, a cadence and a clock, so
 * the thresholds pin without a database — the `pi-health.assess()` split. Only
 * `snapshot()` reads.
 *
 * READ-ONLY throughout. This page must never be the reason something changed.
 *
 * CommonJS — NEURO backend convention.
