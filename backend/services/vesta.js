/**
 * VESTA — the shared home surface.
 *
 * Nick, 31 Aug 2026: evolve the standalone task page for his partner into a
 * generalised capture/display surface she can actually use. First iteration:
 * shared tasks and their state, his calendar with work redacted to "Busy", what
 * is in the fridge and freezer, and something to eat out of it.
 *
 * Named for the goddess of hearth and home, and it sits beside SAiM rather than
 * inside her: SAiM is Nick's, VESTA is the household's.
 *
 * ── The one rule everything here follows ────────────────────────────────────
 * ⚠ **REDACTION HAPPENS HERE, ON THE SERVER, NEVER IN THE PAGE.** If a work
 * subject line reaches the browser it has leaked, whatever the component chooses
 * to render — a devtools tab, a cached response, a screenshot of a network
 * panel. `redactEvent()` is where a title becomes "Busy", and the full subject
 * is not in the object it returns.
 *
 * ⚠ **This is served to the PUBLIC INTERNET.** pi5 runs Tailscale Funnel, so the
 * auth exemption that lets his partner in without a NEURO PIN publishes these
 * routes to anyone who finds them. Everything below follows from that sentence,
 * and it is the same reasoning `capture-links.js` already carries — VESTA
 * reuses that file's accounts, PINs, brute-force throttle and sessions rather
 * than inventing a second credential system.
 *
 * ⚠ **It widens what an account can see, so it is gated per account and DEFAULTS
 * CLOSED** (`capture-links` SCOPES). The old rule was "an account sees only its
 * own submissions"; calendar and kitchen are a real step past that, and an
 * account created before this gets exactly what it had yesterday.
 *
 * ── What is deliberately NOT here ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * Nick's work tasks, his queue, his inbox, his health, his people notes, his
 * meeting notes, anything from the vault other than the kitchen file, and any
 * ability to change an account. A compromised VESTA login must be worth almost
 * nothing.
 *
 * ── What is NOT here any more ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The kitchen's file format and CRUD moved to `services/catalogue.js` while this
 * was being written — the fridge is one CATALOGUE among many (vinyl, hiking
 * equipment), and it never earned a bespoke store. VESTA keeps the two things
 * that are genuinely its own: redacting the diary, and knowing what can be
 * cooked out of a list.
 *
 * PURE where it judges: `redactEvent`, `domainOf` and `suggestMeals` take plain
 * data and return plain data, so the redaction rules pin without a database, a
 * vault or a clock.
 *
 * CommonJS — NEURO backend convention.

 * One calendar row as VESTA is allowed to see it. PURE.
 *
 * Nick's call (31 Aug): work shows as time + "Busy"; personal shows its real
 * title. The split is `domain`, which NEURO already carries — it is not guessed
 * from the wording here, because a classifier having an off day would be the
 * thing that leaks a client name.
 *
 * ⚠ The returned object CONTAINS NO SUBJECT for a work event. Not a truncated
 * one, not one on a field the page happens not to render. It is not there.
