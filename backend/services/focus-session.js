/**
 * The focus session — one thing, started, held as state.
 *
 * The gap this closes: `adhd-dashboard.js` names activation energy as *the*
 * blocker and then answers it with quick wins — a SMALLER thing. That helps on
 * some days and on others it just relocates the avoidance onto an easier
 * target. What was missing is a container: pick the one thing, start it, and
 * have NEURO hold that as state so every surface knows what Nick is mid-way
 * through. The vault has had a hand-maintained `Focus Sessions/` folder since
 * long before this existed, which is the evidence it was wanted.
 *
 * And the reason to build it (#89): get pulled into an escalation mid-task and
 * nothing anywhere says *"you were twenty minutes into X — back to it?"*. For an
 * ADHD brain the interruption is not the cost, the FAILURE TO RETURN is: the
 * thread is gone and the task silently rejoins the pile of 128. Everything
 * needed was already tracked; nothing joined it up. `recovery()` is that join.
 *
 * Six rules, each of them a thing that would otherwise make this untrustworthy:
 *
 * 1. ONE session at a time. Two "current things" is no current thing.
 *
 * 2. Elapsed counts FOCUS time, not wall clock — paused stretches are excluded.
 *    Wall clock would make "twenty minutes into a thirty-minute thing" wrong the
 *    instant you were pulled away, which is precisely the case this exists for.
 *
 * 3. An un-estimated task is assumed thirty minutes and SAYS SO, exactly as in
 *    time-fit (#87). `plannedAssumed` rides on every read and the caller is
 *    expected to show it. Same constant, deliberately imported rather than
 *    re-declared, so the two can never drift.
 *
 * 4. A session that runs away goes STALE — it never auto-completes and never
 *    silently disappears. Auto-completing invents a win Nick did not earn;
 *    deleting loses the thread this whole feature exists to keep. Stale asks.
 *
 * 5. Starting something else INTERRUPTS the current session rather than being
 *    refused or silently replacing it. Being pulled onto another thing is the
 *    normal case, not an error, and it is the moment the return-prompt is born.
 *
 * 6. PULL-ONLY. Nothing here notifies or pushes. The recovery prompt appears on
 *    surfaces Nick has chosen to open. Same call as waiting-on, and for the
 *    stronger reason: nudge volume is the one signal allowed to argue against
 *    building more of this system, so a new feature does not get to raise it.
 *
 * Stored in `agent_state` rather than a table, following standup-session: a
 * schema migration on the live DB is a bigger risk than the query convenience is
 * worth, and there is exactly one live row.
 *
 * NOT built, deliberately: nothing learns durations from the actual times
 * recorded here. #87 ruled that out for want of a body of finished, estimated
 * work to calibrate against — this is what starts creating that body. Consuming
 * it before it exists would be the same mistake as the MoSCoW classifier, a
 * confident number nobody can check.

// INITIATION, and "anything that raises awareness without lowering the barrier
// is the wrong shape". Pause, resume and abandon all raise awareness. Only this
// lowers the barrier.
//
// ⚠ SHRINKING IS NOT FAILURE, and nothing here may record it as one. It is the
// single most useful signal the session produces: a task shrunk three times is
// a task that was never one task. So the shrink is kept as HISTORY on the
// session (`shrinks`), the original wording is preserved (`originalText`), and
// the outcome is logged as its own event rather than folded into an abandon.
//
// Two shapes, and the difference matters:
//   * `shrink({ step })`   — Nick knows the smaller thing. It becomes the next
//                            step and the session carries on.
//   * `shrink({})`         — he knows it is too big and does NOT yet know the

 * "It'll take about 45 minutes" — Nick's own length for the session that is
 * running. Nick, 11 Sep 2026: a session started from an escalation has no task
 * to carry an estimate, and nothing could change one once a session began, so
 * every such session tracked against the assumed thirty minutes for its whole
 * life.
 *
 * ⚠ Asked for AFTER starting, never before. Starting is the hard half, and a
 * "how long?" in front of the clock is friction at exactly the wrong moment.
 *
 * ⚠ LATE IS RECORDED, NOT REFUSED. Set within `ESTIMATE_GRACE_MINUTES` of focus
 * time it is a forecast; set later it is a reading of work already under way,
 * and `plannedLate` keeps it out of every read that scores forecasts. The
 * session still uses it for "about N left" either way — it is the best length
 * anybody has.
 *
 * ⚠ Written back to the task, when there is one, as an EXACT number: he typed
 * it, so #87's laundering rule does not apply, and snapping 45 to an hour would
 * be the planner disagreeing with him about his own work. A failed write-back
 * never fails the estimate — the session is what he is looking at.
