/**
 * mobile-snapshot — "Nick Now", the compact working set Neuro Mobile renders.
 *
 * This is a NEURO-OWNED CONTRACT, deliberately defined here rather than allowed
 * to become "whatever SARA's presentation model happens to be this week". The
 * phone caches it and shows it offline, so its shape is a promise.
 *
 * Three rules run through the whole thing, and they are the same three that run
 * through `attention` and `state-of-play`:
 *
 *  1. EVERY item carries a stable canonical id, a source and an updatedAt. A
 *     cached item with no provenance cannot be labelled honestly a day later.
 *  2. A section that could not be READ is `{known:false, why}` — never an empty
 *     list. "I couldn't look" and "there is nothing" are different facts, and
 *     conflating them is how a broken feed comes to look like a calm day.
 *  3. Nothing here is a bulk dump. Retrieval is POINTERS — title, path, updated
 *     — never private source content, because the point of the cache is a
 *     working set on a device, not a copy of the brain.
 *
 * Read-only. An ambient screen polled every few minutes must never be the reason
 * something changed.
