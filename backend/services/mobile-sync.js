/**
 * mobile-sync — the append-only, idempotent outbox NEURO accepts from a phone.
 *
 * The contract, in one paragraph: the DEVICE owns the identity of an intent
 * (`operationId`, generated locally, before anything reaches the network); NEURO
 * owns the canonical record that intent produces. Re-sending an operation is
 * always safe and never creates a second record. Nothing here mutates an
 * existing canonical record except through semantics NEURO already had.
 *
 * ⚠ THE CONFLICT RULE (documented, and deliberately small):
 *   1. New captures are APPEND-ONLY and idempotent. There is nothing to conflict
 *      with — the record does not exist until the operation lands.
 *   2. Existing canonical records remain SERVER-OWNED. The one mutation in this
 *      phase (`todo.complete`) is idempotent by nature and carries no content.
 *   3. Where a mutation cannot be applied cleanly, the local intent is PRESERVED
 *      and reported as needing attention. Server data is never overwritten and
 *      the device's copy is never discarded. There is no merge, and no
 *      resolution UI — a conflict is a thing Nick is told about, not a dialog.
 *
 * ⚠ Idempotency rests on this module being SYNCHRONOUS from the ledger read to
 * the ledger write. better-sqlite3 is synchronous and this is one Node process,
 * so that read-modify-write genuinely cannot interleave — it is a real mutex
 * here, and would NOT be safe across processes (`plaud-admin-blocks`' rule).
 * Do not make `applyOperation` async.
 *
 * ⚠ Nothing here logs capture text, a PIN or a token. Operation ids and kinds
 * only.
