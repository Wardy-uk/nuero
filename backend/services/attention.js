/**
 * Attention — the one thing SARA should surface right now.
 *
 * NEURO is the brain: it collates and directs. SARA is the voice, ears and eyes,
 * and comes to Nick rather than waiting to be navigated. That makes THIS the
 * feed both SARA surfaces render — one primary thing, its spoken form, and the
 * honest reason it won.
 *
 * ── The rule that keeps this from becoming a second decision engine ──────────
 * Context RE-RANKS and GATES. It never ADDS candidates. `decision-engine` stays
 * the single place something becomes worth surfacing, with the dismiss, snooze
 * and category-suppression it has already learned. All this layer decides is
 * which of that pool fits the moment — and whether to say anything at all.
 *
 * The one exception is deliberate and is not a candidate: when the context
 * itself is the answer ("you're in a meeting", "you're in a focus session"),
 * the primary is a CONTEXT card. It carries no work and claims none; it is SARA
 * describing the frame, not proposing a job. `kind` distinguishes the two so no
 * consumer can mistake one for the other.
 *
 * ── Silence is a correct answer ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * An ambient surface that always has something to say is a nudge machine, and
 * nudge volume is the one signal allowed to argue against building more. In a
 * meeting SARA says nothing. `primary: null` is a valid result, not a failure.
 *
 * ── Confidence decides how much we are allowed to HIDE ───────────────────────
 * Two different powers, two different bars:
 *   * QUIET (don't speak) follows the context and fails towards silence — the
 *     cost of a wrong silence is a thing Nick finds a minute later.
 *   * DROPPING (hide work) requires a confident read. A low-confidence context
 *     may still re-order, but it must never remove anything, because hiding
 *     real work on a bad guess is the failure that ends the feature. This is
 *     `state-of-play`'s "a board opening with false warnings is one nobody
 *     reads by week two", pointed the other way.
 *
 * Nothing here is dropped silently — `dropped` names every item and why.
 *
 * ── Why the speech is deterministic ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * No model call. This is polled continuously by two surfaces and has to be
 * instant and work with the Pi offline — `event-parser`'s regex-first rule. The
 * card already carries wording written for a human; rephrasing it through a
 * model would spend latency to make it less predictable, not more useful.
 *
 * CommonJS only — NEURO backend convention.

 * Is the running focus session about THIS card? PURE.

 * place — a task id when both have one, otherwise `task-store.dedupeKey` over
 * the wording. That equivalence is the whole point: the card that WOULD start
 * this session is exactly the card that must show it as already running. Any
 * looser rule marks the wrong card; any stricter one leaves `Start this` on a
 * card whose session is live, which is the bug being fixed.
 *
 * ⚠ `session.text`, never `nextStep`. Shrinking changes the step and leaves the
 * task alone, so a session cut down to "open the doc and list the headings"
 * still belongs to the card it started from — matching on the step would lose
 * the card the moment it became most useful.
 *
 * Returns false rather than throwing on anything unreadable: an unmatched card
 * simply behaves as it did before this existed.
