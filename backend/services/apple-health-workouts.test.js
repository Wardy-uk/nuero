 * Workouts — the record-shaped section that retires Strava.
 *
 * ⚠ WRITTEN WITHOUT A REAL HEALTH AUTO EXPORT WORKOUT PAYLOAD. The section has
 * always been counted and discarded, so no captured example exists anywhere in
 * this repo. These tests pin the spellings the parser was TAUGHT and — more
 * importantly — that an unrecognised field is reported rather than swallowed.
 * When the first live payload arrives, `unknownWorkoutFields` in the ingest
 * response is what says which of these guesses was wrong.
 *
 * The parser is pure, so all of this holds without a DB, a network or a phone.
