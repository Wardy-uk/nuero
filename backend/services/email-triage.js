// Not wrong the way `inbox_items` was wrong, but the same shape of mistake one
// step later: a store nobody empties.
//
// A dismissed entry is kept for exactly three reasons, and none needs the
// whole email:
//   1. The merge in `runTriage` must not resurrect it while its id can still
//      come back in the 24-hour fetch window. Seven days is a wide margin.
//   2. The #70 feedback score reads urgency/category/dismissReason.
//   3. The model's verdict must survive, or the mail is re-classified on every
//      run for as long as it is still being fetched (see DISMISSED_FIELDS).
// So dismissed entries are COMPACTED to those fields on write (668 KB → 192 KB
// on today's data, and the id is most of what remains), then pruned by age —
// with their contribution to the feedback score ROLLED UP first, so pruning
// costs history rather than throwing it away. The classifier's only free
// feedback signal must not quietly reset every week.
// DERIVED FROM THE LOOKBACK WINDOW, never a fixed number again. It was a
// literal 7 while the comment above still described a 24-hour fetch, and the
// window widened to 14 days on 1 Sep without it - so a dismissal on mail still
// sitting in the Inbox was pruned at day 7, re-fetched on day 8, and came back
// as new. "It keeps coming back", for the SAME email. A dismissed entry has to
// outlive every fetch that can still return its id, so the retention is the

// means "keep this in front of me" — expired in 24 hours.
//

//   • The window is 14 days, PAGED, so a fetch is a real walk of the period
//     rather than the newest 40 messages.

/**
 * How the classifier is doing, by its own output, against Nick's verdict.
 *
 * Deliberately counts only what he has actually judged: an email still sitting
 * in triage is not evidence either way, and folding it in would make the score
 * improve simply because he has not got to it yet.
 *
 * `judged` counts VERDICTS, not emails — an email promoted and later marked
 * done carries two, because Nick said two separate things about it. Triage can
 * be wrong in both directions and `misrankRate` now covers both: over-ranking
 * (`notRelevant`) and under-ranking (`underRanked`). A score that only ever
 * counted the over-ranked half flattered the classifier for the failure that
 * costs most — mail Nick never sees.
