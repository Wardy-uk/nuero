 * "toISOString() shifts the day either side of midnight in BST".
 *
 * It survived only because the Pi runs on UTC, where the two agree. Everything
 * else in this file reads the SYSTEM clock — `isPastStandupCutoff` uses
 * `getHours()`, and all 25 `cron.schedule` calls run in the system timezone
 * with no `timezone` option passed. So the moment the Pi is moved to
 * Europe/London, cron and `getHours()` move to BST while this stayed on UTC,
 * and between 00:00 and 01:00 BST every nudge would be created under
 * YESTERDAY's key. `getActiveNudgeByTypeAndDate` would not find today's, so
 * `triggerStandupNudge` would create a duplicate every run, and
 * `clearStaleNudges` — which retires anything with `date_key < todayKey()` —
 * would bin the lot an hour later.
 *
 * `now` is injectable for the same reason the rest of this file does it.

// ── Days Nick is not working ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Two separate reasons a ritual nudge must not fire, and they are kept apart
// because they are answerable by different things and Nick can only control one.
//
//   BANK HOLIDAY — the crons are already `* * 1-5`, so weekends were handled,
//     but nothing in the nudge path had ever heard of a bank holiday. This is
//     the sixth place in the repo where "working day" quietly meant Mon-Fri
//     (see the working-days note in CLAUDE.md), and it was days from proving
//     it: Monday 31 Aug 2026 is the Summer bank holiday, and without this the
//     standup, todo and EOD nudges would all have fired on a day off.
//
//   ANNUAL LEAVE — Nick's own declaration, because nothing else can know. Graph
//     OOF events exist and `working-days.leaveDates()` reads them, but they
//     depend on him having blocked it out in Outlook AND on Graph answering;
//     a button that works with the Pi offline and needs no calendar is the one
//     he will actually press when he is already on holiday.
//
// ⚠ THE LINE THIS DRAWS: nudges go quiet, alarms still ring. Everything in
// NUDGE_TYPES is a nudge about Nick's working rhythm — including the escalation
// and email BANNERS — and none of it should chase him on a day off. The
// separate `escalation_alert` / `system_alert` pushes (briefing.js, watchdog)
// are in webpush's ALWAYS_DELIVER and are deliberately NOT touched: those are
// "something is on fire", and going quiet on those is a bigger decision than a
// leave button should be allowed to make on its own.

 * The first line is HERS, and she says it before he asks.
 *
 * Nick, 31 Aug 2026, on what would make SARA feel less reactive: she should
 * INITIATE the End of Day rather than NEURO announcing that it is time for one.
 *
 * The old notification was an instruction — *"End of day. Before you close the
 * laptop: one win, one thing that didn't go to plan... Standup tab → EOD."* That
 * is a label and a set of homework. It tells him a ritual is due; it is not SARA
 * saying anything.
 *
 * So the session is STARTED SERVER-SIDE first, which runs a turn and produces
 * her actual opening line, and THAT is what the notification carries. He taps it
 * and walks into a conversation already begun, rather than an empty form. Same
 * rule #109/#111 established for nudges generally: the words are the BODY, and a
 * title is only a label.
 *
 * ⚠ IT NEVER COSTS HIM THE PROMPT. Starting the session is an AI call, and an AI
 * call can fail — no credit, rate limit, provider down. Every failure falls back
 * to the old wording rather than to silence, because a missed EOD is the thing
 * this exists to prevent and a clever opener is not worth losing it over.
 *
 * ⚠ IT DOES NOT INTERRUPT A CONVERSATION ALREADY HAPPENING. If he started the
 * EOD himself at four o'clock and is mid-flow, `start()` returns that session
 * untouched and this sends nothing — a push at 5pm saying "how was your day?"
 * into a chat he is already in reads as SARA not listening.
