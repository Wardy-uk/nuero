  "The standup awaits. Three questions. You've done this before.",
  "The day has begun. The standup has not. One of these is a problem.",
  "Standup. It's literally three questions. You answer them every day. Today is a day.",
  // Tier 2 — Mild exasperation
  "Still no standup. Bold choice. The Standup tab remains available.",
  "Interesting. No standup yet. Very interesting. Extremely interesting.",
  "The standup is not going to write itself. I've checked. Multiple times.",
  "You've had 15 minutes. In that time you could have written the standup approximately 5 times.",
  "Just popping by to mention the standup. Again. As I do.",
  "Standup update: still not done. Thank you for attending my TED talk.",
  "I notice the standup remains in a Schrödinger state — neither done nor officially abandoned.",
  "Friendly reminder that visibility is literally phase 1 of your 90-day plan. Just saying.",
  "The standup is just sitting there. Waiting. It's very patient. I am less so.",
  "Quick check-in: standup status? (The answer is: not done. I already know. I'm asking rhetorically.)",
  "Still here. Still nudging. Still believing in you. Do the standup.",
  "No standup yet. That's fine. Everything is fine. (Do the standup.)",
  // Tier 3 — Genuinely exasperated
  "Nick. NICK. The standup. It's been 45 minutes.",
  "At this point the standup has been pending longer than some of your Jira tickets.",
  "I want you to know I have sent you multiple reminders and I am starting to take this personally.",
  "The standup takes 3 minutes. You have now spent longer avoiding it than doing it would take.",
  "I'm not angry. I'm just... disappointed. Actually no, I'm a bit angry. Do the standup.",
  "Fun fact: the time you've spent not doing the standup is now longer than the standup itself. By a lot.",
  "Checking in on the standup. No reason. Just every 15 minutes. Forever. Until it's done.",
  "Your 90-day plan literally starts with visibility. The standup IS the visibility. The irony is not lost on me.",
  "At what point does this become impressive? Because I think we might be there.",
  "The standup is still not done and I've started writing a memoir about waiting for it.",
  "I have now reminded you about the standup more times than you have direct reports. Let that sink in.",
  "Three bullet points, Nick. THREE. You have 15 direct reports. This should be trivial.",

  "The queue is growing. The standup is not. These facts are related.",

  "I have been patient. I have been reasonable. I have been many things. I am now going to be persistent.",
  "At this point the standup is a character in a tragedy. Its name is Undone. Its nemesis is Avoidance.",
  "You know what's funny? The standup. Because it's still not done. That's the joke. Do it.",
  "I've done the maths. You could have written this standup 47 times in the time you've spent not writing it.",
  "The standup is now older than several of your Jira tickets. It deserves better.",
  "Okay. New approach. Imagine the standup is a tiny creature that needs feeding. Feed it. With words.",
  "I'm going to level with you: I don't know what you're doing right now but the standup is more important.",
  "The standup. The humble standup. Three questions. Standing between you and a clear conscience. Do it.",
  "We are now entering hour two. I have outlasted your snooze, your coffee, and apparently your motivation.",
  "At this point I'm just impressed. Genuinely. This is commitment to the bit. But the bit is avoidance. Stop.",

  "You know this pattern. I know this pattern. The pattern knows itself. Break it. Standup.",
  "Fine. Let's try this. What IS the actual blocker? Talk to me. Or just do the standup. Either works.",
  // Tier 6 — Nuclear
  "I have now been asking for the standup for longer than some people's entire shifts. Remarkable.",
  "The standup has achieved legendary status. Songs will be written about the day it almost happened.",
  "At this point I'm not sure if you've forgotten or if this is a philosophical statement. Either way: standup.",
  "Somewhere a Jira ticket is ageing ungraciously. Its assignee is one of your 15 reports. Standup would have helped.",
  "I've started a support group for nudges that don't get acknowledged. Attendance is high today.",
  "You are the first person to make a standup feel like an act of rebellion. I respect it. Do it anyway.",
  "The standup. Still undone. Still waiting. More patient than I am. We should all learn from the standup.",
  "I'm not going to stop. This is not a threat. It's a promise. Standup.",
  "Okay. Real talk. You're good at this job. You know what else you'd be good at? The standup. Go.",
  "The irony of the Head of Technical Support having an open ticket for 'undone standup' is not lost on me.",
  "I've now sent more standup reminders than you have teeth. That's too many. Do the standup.",
  "At some point avoidance becomes art. At other points it becomes a problem. We passed art an hour ago.",
  // Tier 7 — Fond / personal
  "I know your brain. I know this pattern. I'm not judging — well, a little. Three bullets. That's all.",
  "Look. It's been a day. I get it. But the standup will make you feel better. It always does.",
  "The standup is just a mirror. Yesterday, today, blockers. You know this. You're good at this.",
  "You built me to know when you're avoiding things. You are avoiding the standup. I am knowing it loudly.",
  "The 90-day clock is ticking. Visibility is phase 1. You're good at this. Show that you're good at this.",
  "Other people have AI assistants that are polite about this. You chose me. I take that as permission to persist.",
  "You have 15 direct reports, a growing queue, and a 90-day plan to deliver. Standup is how you hold all of it.",
  "I genuinely believe you can do this standup. I have believed it for the last two hours. The belief remains.",
