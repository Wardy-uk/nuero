/**
 * Capture accounts — a small, standalone task screen for the people in Nick's
 * house. Served at its own address (tasks.nickward.co.uk), behind a username
 * and PIN, showing each person what THEY have sent and what became of it.
 *
 * ── Why it is not a NEURO login ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Nick's wife needs to give him a task and see whether he has done it. She has
 * no iOS device, so a shared Reminders list is out, and she must never have the
 * NEURO PIN — that unlocks the whole brain: his queue, his inbox, his 1-2-1
 * notes, his health. This is a separate credential with a separate blast radius.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS IS THE ONLY PART OF NEURO DELIBERATELY OPEN TO THE PUBLIC INTERNET.
 * pi5 runs Tailscale Funnel, so exempting a path from the PIN middleware
 * publishes it to anyone, not merely to the tailnet. Everything below follows
 * from that sentence.
 *
 * ── What an account can see, and what it cannot ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * ONLY ITS OWN SUBMISSIONS. Nick asked for status back, which is a real change
 * from the first write-only cut — but "what I sent, and is it done" is a much
 * smaller claim than "Nick's task list", and the difference is enforced by
 * matching on `source = capture:<label>` rather than by filtering a fuller list
 * in the UI. Nothing else about his day is reachable from here: not his other
 * tasks, not counts, not the calendar.
 *
 * ── Why a PIN and not a secret link ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The first design put an unguessable token in the URL. That is fine for a
 * write-only door and wrong for one that shows anything back, because a URL
 * leaks in ways a password does not — browser history, a shared phone, a
 * screenshot, a message forwarded to the wrong person. A PIN is entered, not
 * stored in a link.
 *
 * ⚠ A PIN is also SHORT, and therefore brute-forceable, which is why the
 * throttle below is not optional and is the single most important thing in this
 * file. It is per account, persisted, and it counts failures rather than
 * requests so a person typing their own PIN wrong twice is unaffected.

// ── What an account may SEE (VESTA, 31 Aug 2026) ─────────────────────────────
//
// The original rule here was absolute: an account sees ONLY its own
// submissions, and "nothing else about Nick's day is reachable — not his other
// tasks, not counts, not the calendar." VESTA deliberately widens that for one
// person: his partner gets a shared home surface with his diary (redacted), the
// kitchen and shared tasks on it.
//
// ⚠ So it is a per-account CAPABILITY and it DEFAULTS CLOSED. Widening the rule
// globally would silently hand every existing account sight of his calendar,
// which is the exact shape of accident this whole file exists to prevent. An
// account created before this has no `scopes` key at all and therefore gets
// `['tasks']` — precisely what it could do yesterday.
//
// `tasks` is implicit and always granted: it is what an account IS.
// ⚠ `presence` is Nick's real-time location INSIDE the house, published to an
// endpoint that is on the PUBLIC INTERNET behind a Tailscale funnel. It is the
// most personal thing this mount can carry — finer than a calendar, and live —
// so it is its own scope, granted deliberately, and it is NOT in DEFAULT_SCOPES.
// Nothing bundles it with `calendar` or `kitchen`: a scope that arrives as a
// side effect of wanting the shopping list is not consent.
// ⚠ `hike` is Nick's live position ON A HILL, during a walk he armed in hike
// safety — coordinates, his trail and the route. Finer still than `presence`,
// so it is its own scope and not a default. It shows nothing at all unless a
// walk is armed, and no coordinates once he has checked in.
