/**
 * Is this reading worth putting on a screen at all?
 *
 * ⚠ ONE DECISION, TAKEN HERE, so every surface gates on the same answer. The
 * phone, the kiosk, the Electron window and both iOS apps each rendered the
 * dial unconditionally, which means the most common possible reading —
 * "Balanced", i.e. a perfectly ordinary day — took a permanent slot on the
 * screen. That is the 29 Aug rule about the morning brief, one surface along:
 * "About normal today" appended every morning is padding, and padding is how
 * the line above it stops being read.
 *
 * ⚠ THE LADDER IS THE ONE THIS FILE ALREADY PUBLISHES, not a new threshold.
 * `Balanced` is the 40..59 band and is the only one that is not notable — a
 * second set of numbers here is how a screen comes to disagree with the service
 * about what kind of day it is.
 *
 * ⚠ CALIBRATING AND STALE ARE NOT NOTABLE. There is no reading to be off
 * baseline, and a dial that appears whenever the watch has been on charge is
 * one that appears for no reason.
 *
 * ⚠ A CAVEAT IS NOT A REASON TO SHOW IT. "Heart rate is well above resting"
 * rides WITH a score when one is shown; on its own it is a fact about the last
 * ten minutes, not about the day.
 *
 * Pure — takes the score object, no clock, no DB.
