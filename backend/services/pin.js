/**
 * Changing the NEURO PIN from the UI.
 *
 * Until now the PIN could only be changed by editing `backend/.env` over SSH and
 * restarting the backend — which is why, when it turned out to have been sitting
 * in a PUBLIC repo since 15 July (#123), rotating it was a manual job that had
 * been outstanding for days. A credential you cannot rotate from the app is a
 * credential that does not get rotated.
 *
 * **`.env` stays the single source of truth, deliberately.** The AI settings
 * precedent puts runtime config in `agent_state` and bootstraps it into
 * `process.env` on first request — that is right for an API key, and wrong for
 * this. The PIN is checked by the `/api` middleware on EVERY request including
 * the first, so a DB-backed value has a window at boot where the stored PIN is
 * not loaded yet and the stale `.env` one is still live. Worse, it would create
 * exactly the two-sources-of-truth split (`.env` says one thing, the DB another)
 * that this repo keeps having to unpick. Writing `.env` keeps one answer, and it
 * is what a human would have done over SSH anyway.
 *
 * Immediate effect comes from also setting `process.env.NEURO_PIN` in memory, so
 * no restart is needed; the file write is what survives one.
 *
 * ⚠ The backup goes to the OS temp dir, never beside `.env`, and the checked
 * reason matters. `.gitignore` covers `.env` and — by a general `*.bak-*` rule —
 * the hand-made `.env.bak-…` files already sitting in `backend/`. It does NOT
 * cover the names this file would generate: `git check-ignore` says both
 * `neuro-env-backup-<ts>` and `.env.tmp-<pid>-<ts>` are committable. So a
 * secret written beside `.env` here would have been one `git add -A` from the
 * public repo — the failure #123 and the #59 crypt-secret leak were both
 * instances of. `.env.tmp-*` is now also gitignored as a second line of
 * defence, for the case where a crash between write and rename strands one.
