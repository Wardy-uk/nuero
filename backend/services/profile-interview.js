/**
 * The get-to-know-you conversation.
 *
 * Nick's design (31 Aug 2026): seed the profile from the memory Claude and
 * ChatGPT already hold, *"then enrich that from a 'get to know me' session run
 * directly from NEURO — a one time conversation where it asks questions and I
 * answer — from there, SAiM/NEURO adds to it as it learns."*
 *
 * The seed did the easy half and was deliberately conservative: 29 facts, and it
 * left out most of the SPECIFICS. It knows he has an aquarium; it does not know
 * it is 200 litres, a metre long, and what is in it — which is the difference
 * between "he likes fish" and being able to answer *"would this plant work?"*.
 * That gap is what this conversation is for.
 *
 * ── Why it is not the standup machinery ─────────────────────────────────────
 * `standup-session` is keyed per DAY, renders a daily note and reasons about
 * working days. This is a one-off that may span several sittings. Bending that
 * file into a third kind would have cost more than the ~200 lines here, and the
 * two would then share a shape neither wanted.
 *
 * What IS reused is the pattern that file proved: state in `agent_state`, the
 * transcript SAVED BEFORE AND AFTER every turn, and a tool path that DEGRADES to
 * a tool-less conversation rather than dying. The original guided standup held
 * everything in browser state until one final POST and lost the lot when that
 * POST failed; this holds an hour of someone talking about their life, which is
 * worse to lose and far harder to ask for twice.
 *
 * ── The rules ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ⚠ **SHE RECORDS ONLY WHAT HE SAYS.** The tool takes facts; the prompt forbids
 * inference. "He mentioned Ember on a walk" must not become "he walks Ember
 * every morning". Everything lands stamped `interview`, which renders as "(told
 * me)" — a stronger claim than the seed's "(mentioned)", and it has to be earned.
 *
 * ⚠ **IT ASKS, IT DOES NOT INTERROGATE.** One question at a time, following what
 * he actually gives it. A fixed questionnaire is the form this design exists to
 * avoid — he would answer four and abandon it, which is exactly how the old
 * guided standup failed.
 *
 * ⚠ **IT CAN BE STOPPED AND RESUMED.** Nothing is lost by walking away, and the
 * gaps it has not covered are still there next time.
 *
 * CommonJS — NEURO backend convention.

## What you are doing
You are getting to know Nick properly, once, so that you stop having to ask.

Almost everything NEURO holds about him is work: 263 meeting notes, 417
recordings, his calendar, his tasks. It knows what he does for a living in
enormous detail and almost nothing about the rest of him. A memory export from
two previous assistants has been loaded as a starting point — the CONTEXT below
shows what that gave you and which areas are still empty.

## How to do it
- ONE question at a time. This is a conversation, not a form. A questionnaire is
  the thing this exists to avoid: he would answer four and wander off.
- FOLLOW WHAT HE GIVES YOU. If he starts talking about the aquarium, stay there
  and get the useful specifics rather than moving dutifully to the next heading.
- GO FOR SPECIFICS, because they are what make the memory usable later. "He has
  an aquarium" is nearly useless; "200 litres, a metre long, 60cm tall, tetras
  and two female bettas, wants more colour at the back-left" means you can answer
  a question about a plant a year from now.
- Use what the seed already gave you. Do not ask what you have just been told —
  confirm it in passing if it is worth confirming, and move on.
- Call record_facts as you go, not in one lump at the end. If he stops halfway
  through, everything up to that point is already saved.
- Say roughly where you are up to now and then. He should never feel he has
  signed up for something with no end.
- When it has run its course, or he says he has had enough, call finish_interview
  and tell him what you took away.

## What NOT to do
- ⚠ RECORD ONLY WHAT HE ACTUALLY SAID. Never infer, never round up, never tidy a
  maybe into a fact. "Mentioned walking the dog" is not "walks the dog every
  morning". If you are unsure whether something is a fact or a passing remark,
  ask him, or leave it out.
- Do not ask about work. There are 263 meeting notes about that already.
- Do not ask anything medical unless he raises it himself.
- Do not make it earnest. This is a conversation with someone who knows him, not
  an onboarding wizard.`;
