 * from Nick's own meetings, so they all read "Nick will <verb> the <support

 * live queue on 27 Aug 2026 (258 pending, 54 distinct), 0.42 merged two pairs
 * and BOTH were wrong — the worst folded "meet Naomi on 26/27 Aug to review and
 * sign the risk assessment" into "complete the remaining sections of the risk
 * assessment form", which would have hidden a dated meeting behind a form.
 *
 * Measured separation in the real operating condition (scored against the whole
 * pool, which is what changes the IDF and therefore the scores):
 *
 *   exact repeat .................. 1.000
 *   case / punctuation variant .... 1.000

 *   same job, one clause dropped .. 1.000

 *   worst live false positive ..... 0.499
 *   genuinely new commitment ...... 0.150
 *
 * 0.85 sits in that gap. It is deliberately at the conservative end, because the
 * two directions are not symmetric: a missed fold leaves a duplicate row, which
 * is visible, cheap and the status quo — while a wrong fold hides a real
 * commitment inside an unrelated one, silently, in the queue Nick uses to find

 * the actions from them itself. The hook path never did, so a NOVA-owned 1-2-1
 * routed into `Meetings/` by `imports` had its actions extracted by NEURO via
 * the hook AND by NOVA: one conversation, two systems, and Nick reviewing the
 * same commitment twice in two different places.
 *
 * ⚠ **It fails OPEN, in both directions that matter.** With nothing cached
 * nothing is excluded and extraction happens as before: a duplicate candidate
 * is visible and cheap, a missed commitment is neither. And a cached set that
 * has since gone stale can only ever over-exclude for as long as it takes the
 * background refresh to land — after which the nightly sweep, which always uses
 * a FRESH set, re-reads every meeting note from the last seven days and picks up
 * anything this wrongly skipped.
