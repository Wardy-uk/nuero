/**
 * The obligation inside an email, lifted out of it.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `email-triage` has worked for months: it fetches 14 days of mail, classifies
 * it into lanes and stores the result. Not one of its exports creates a task or
 * a candidate, and the file contains no reference to `task-store`, `createTask`
 * or `action-candidates` — the chain stops at classification. So an email
 * reading *"Nick, can you get me the headcount numbers by Friday"* became an
 * ACTION-lane card in InboxPanel and nothing more. The lane says THIS EMAIL
 * NEEDS ATTENTION; nothing anywhere said THIS IS A THING YOU AGREED TO DO.
 * Measured live 3 Sep 2026: urgent 16, reply 11, action-lane 27, oldest
 * unanswered 20 Aug, and not one of them had ever become a task.
 *
 * This is the other half of the queue `action-candidates` fills from meeting
 * notes. It emits the SAME `capture_todo` shape into the SAME table, so the
 * existing queue, the cross-note fold, the dedupe and the approval path all
 * take it unchanged.
 *
 * ── Four rules, and the first one is the whole safety model ──────────────────
 *
 * 1. **REVIEW-ONLY. Nothing here ever promotes.** `autoPromote` is a hardcoded
 *    false and there is no path to `task-store` in this file — a test asserts
 *    both. An email is somebody ELSE'S wording about what Nick owes, read from
 *    a short preview, and a false task minted from a marketing mail is exactly
 *    what makes a review queue stop being read. Confidence is capped well below
 *    `AUTO_PROMOTE_CONFIDENCE`, so it cannot drift over the line later either.
 *
 * 2. **Two lanes only** — `urgent` and `reply`. FYI, DELEGATE and IGNORE are
 *    the lanes triage has already judged as not Nick's to act on, and running
 *    the extractor over them would spend money re-litigating a decision that
 *    has already been made, on much the largest bucket (166 FYI against 27
 *    action).
 *
 * 3. **An answer is bought ONCE.** An email's text never changes, so neither
 *    does what can be extracted from it. The ledger records BOTH outcomes — "an
 *    obligation, here it is" and "nothing owed in this one" — because without
 *    the second, every quiet email is re-bought every 30 minutes for fourteen
 *    days. ⚠ A FAILED batch records NOTHING and is retried: the whole point of
 *    `aiClassified` one file over is that "the model never saw it" and "the
 *    model read it and said nothing" must not be the same record.
 *
 * 4. **It never invents a due date.** The model is asked for the obligation in
 *    plain words, not for a date; a Friday inferred from "by Friday" is a guess
 *    about WHICH Friday, and a wrong date on a task is worse than no date.
 *    Whatever the email said about timing stays in the reason line, where a
 *    human reads it.
