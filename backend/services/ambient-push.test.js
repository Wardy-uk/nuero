/**
 * When an ambient observation is worth interrupting for.
 *
 * The correction this file exists to hold: whether something is worth saying is
 * a property of the MOMENT, not of the signal. I had said water should never
 * push; Nick's answer was *"if I'm sat in the office and haven't recorded a
 * drink in hours, that should be called out — if I'm in a meeting, or hiking,
 * then not."*
 *
 * So the tests are moments, and most of them are moments where SAiM should say
 * nothing.
