 * deliberate stopping point rather than an unfinished one: sending needs an
 * APNs signing key, which needs a paid Apple Developer account Nick does not
 * have. Registering from day one means the moment the account exists the only
 * missing piece is the key — and, crucially, it means NOTHING IN NEURO CLAIMS A
 * NOTIFICATION WAS DELIVERED in the meantime. `webpush.sendToAll` already
 * records `undeliverable` rather than staying silent when it cannot deliver;
 * this follows the same rule by not pretending to be a transport at all.
 *
 * ⚠ When the sender is written it must go BEHIND the existing gates in
 * `services/webpush.js`, not beside them. Quiet hours, the hourly cap, the
 * content fingerprint that stops a countdown re-notifying, the attention
 * lifecycle and the delivery log are all transport-agnostic and were paid for
 * in real bugs. A second delivery path that skips them would reintroduce every
 * one — the "in 25 min" / "in 10 min" duplicate being the obvious first.
 *
 * Validation is pure so the wire contract pins without a database.
