/**
 * Meeting triage — does this invitation say what it is for?
 *
 * Policy (Nick, 14 Aug 2026): ANY meeting without an agenda or expected
 * outcomes gets a request for one, seniority included. That is deliberately a
 * blanket rule rather than a whitelist — a policy applied to everyone is easier
 * to defend and easier to live with than a judgement about who is worth asking.
 *
 * The rules therefore go on TONE and WHAT IS ASKED FOR, not on who is exempt:
 *
 *   - Ask for the outcome, not "an agenda". "What does good look like by the
 *     end?" is answerable in one line; "please provide an agenda" sounds like
 *     process for its own sake and gets ignored.
 *   - Never imply the meeting is unnecessary. The request is to prepare well,
 *     not to challenge whether it should exist.
 *   - Always offer the out: happy to go ahead regardless. Otherwise it reads as
 *     a condition of attendance, which is not what this is.
 *   - Same words for everyone. If the wording would embarrass you sent to the
 *     CEO, it is the wrong wording for anyone.
 *
 * Nothing here sends. It produces a draft that queues for approval.
