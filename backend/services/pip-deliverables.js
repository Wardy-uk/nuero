/**
 * What Nick owes Chris, whether it was produced, and when the next one is due.
 *
 * ── What this is, and the thing it deliberately is not ──────────────────────
 *
 * It is a DELIVERABLE TRACKER. It answers "what do I owe and when", from
 * records that already exist, and it never grades him.
 *
 * The obvious version of this feature is a burn-down: a percentage against
 * 11 Oct, four competency bars filling up. That version is refused, and the
 * reason is written down in VANTAGE's `self.js`, about exactly this data:
 * *"None of this is scored or graded. It is assembled so a coach can ask a
 * better question, and a tool that turned it into a performance number would be
 * doing the opposite of the job."* Chris is the one assessing the PIP. A tool
 * that scores it for him produces a number Nick will argue with instead of a
 * list he can act on — and on a bad week it is a screen that tells a man whose
 * failure mode is avoidance that he is failing. So: counts of what exists,
 * names of what does not, dates. No percentage, no score, no RAG, no trend
 * arrow. Pinned by a test that scans the payload for the vocabulary.
 *
 * ── Where the facts come from ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Nothing here is a new measurement. `weekly-risk` has recorded every published
 * and every sent weekly summary since it shipped, and `management-log.assess()`
 * already computes both competency-3 and competency-4 figures. This joins them
 * and adds the calendar. If a number here disagrees with those screens, those
 * screens are right.
 *
 * ── The refusals ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. PRODUCED AND SENT ARE DIFFERENT FACTS. `weekly-risk` keeps them apart on
 *    purpose (`publishedAt` vs `sentRecord`) — a published week is a draft on
 *    disk, and reporting it as delivered would tell Nick he had sent something
 *    Chris has never seen. That is the single most expensive mistake this file
 *    could make, so `produced` and `sent` are counted separately and a week
 *    that is one but not the other is named.
 *
 * 2. A WEEK BEFORE THE CADENCE EXISTED IS NOT OWED. The Monday-midday cadence
 *    was agreed at the 1-2-1 on 12 Aug 2026, three weeks after the PIP began.
 *    Counting the weeks before it as missed would manufacture failures against
 *    a standard that did not exist — the tracker inventing a worse record than
 *    the real one, in the place he checks before writing to his manager.
 *
 * 3. AN UNREADABLE STORE IS A GAP, NEVER A MISS. "I could not read it" and "you
 *    did not do it" are opposite facts, and only one of them is an accusation.
 *    Every read that fails is NAMED and `known` goes false. `wins`' founding
 *    rule, and it matters more here than anywhere it has been applied before.
 *
 * 4. THE CURRENT WEEK IS NOT LATE UNTIL IT IS LATE. Before Monday midday it is
 *    `due`; after, with nothing produced, it is `late`. A tracker that opens on
 *    Monday morning already calling the week missed is one he stops opening.
 *
 * PURE where it judges: `assess()` takes plain records and a clock — the
 * `pi-health.assess()` / `friction.assess()` split. Only `build()` reads.
 *
 * CommonJS — NEURO backend convention.

 * 17 Aug, and w/c 31 Aug at 11:31 on 1 Sep, seventy-two minutes before the
 * recorder was deployed. Both are evidenced by executed `send_weekly_risk_report`
 * actions in `saim_actions`; neither could have left a send record, because
 * nothing was writing one.
 *
 * So for those weeks "no send recorded" is not a fact about Nick, it is a fact
 * about NEURO's own history — a READER THAT PREDATES ITS WRITER'S DATA, which
 * is the mirror of the stale-Jira-cache bug and just as invisible. Reporting it
 * as an outstanding item would ask him to re-record sends that demonstrably
 * happened, every week, for ever.
 *
 * Weeks before this are reported as UNMEASURABLE and are never chased. A week
