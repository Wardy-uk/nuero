/**
 * Initiation signals — the work that makes work possible.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every reward surface in NEURO counts finishing. `wins` counts finished work,
 * `weekly-target` counts closed tasks, `adhd-dashboard._momentum` counts both.
 * Nick's stated failure mode is INITIATION, not completion — so the whole
 * reward apparatus is pointed at the half of the loop that is not broken.
 *
 * Four acts are counted here, and none of them is finishing something:
 *
 *   STARTS    he began a session on a thing
 *   SHRINKS   he cut a thing down until it was startable
 *   TRIAGE    he decided a task's shape — due date, estimate, MoSCoW
 *   ESTIMATES how his own guesses compare with what the work took
 *
 * `focus-session` has recorded every start, every shrink and every planned-vs-
 * actual pair since it shipped, and NOTHING has ever read them back as a
 * signal. Triage was recorded nowhere at all until `task_triaged` landed
 * alongside this. It adds no store and no counter of its own: everything here
 * is derived from records of things Nick actually did, so it cannot drift from
 * them.
 *
 * ── The rules, which are the product ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. A START COUNTS EVEN IF IT WENT NOWHERE. Sessions that were abandoned,
 *    expired or interrupted are counted exactly like finished ones. This is the
 *    whole point: rewarding only the starts that became finishes is the surface
 *    NEURO already has. `endedReason` is never filtered on.
 *
 * 2. THE LIVE SESSION COUNTS. It is not in history until it ends, so a count
 *    drawn from history alone is short by one for as long as he is working —
 *    wrong in the one direction that matters, at the one moment it is read.
 *
 * 3. YOU CANNOT BEAT AN ESTIMATE YOU DID NOT MAKE. A session with
 *    `plannedAssumed` is measured against NEURO's own 30-minute assumption, not
 *    against a judgement Nick made, so it is EXCLUDED from the estimate read
 *    and the exclusion is reported. Scoring him against a number the system
 *    invented is the #87 rule — a guess laundered into a measurement — wearing
 *    a game's clothes.
 *
 * 4. NO STREAKS, NO SCORES, NO GRADES. The wins streak died because it counted
 *    consecutive days with any win, jumped 4 -> 35 and became unbreakable; a
 *    number that cannot go down is not a signal (`wins.typicalDay`). The
 *    comparison here is the same one that replaced it: Nick against his own
 *    recent median, never against zero and never against anyone else.
 *
 * 5. SHRINKING IS EVIDENCE ABOUT THE WORK, NEVER ABOUT NICK. `friction.js`
 *    holds this rule and it holds here unchanged. "Started at 'rewrite the
 *    escalation policy', moved on 'open the doc and list the headings'" is a
 *    fact about how a task had to be cut up. It is never a failure, never a
 *    count against him, and no wording here may imply either.
 *
 *    ⚠ This is NOT `friction.js`'s shrink insight and does not replace it. That
 *    one reports a PATTERN across 21 days — one task shrunk repeatedly may need
 *    a different shape. This reports the ACT, on the day, as the thing that got
 *    him moving. Same evidence, opposite question.
 *
 * 6. THE HISTORY IS CAPPED AND SAYS SO. `focus-session.HISTORY_LIMIT` is 50, so
 *    any window wide enough to reach the cap yields a FLOOR, not a total. A
 *    capped count reported as a total is the silent-cap species this codebase
 *    has shipped five times; `complete` carries the answer.
 *
 * 7. A DAY BEFORE THE HISTORY BEGINS IS UNKNOWN, NOT ZERO. Within the covered
 *    window a weekday with no session is a real zero — he started nothing, and
 *    dropping those would make `typical` the typical of days he already started
 *    something, which flatters every ordinary day into looking below normal.
 *    Before the oldest record there is no such claim to make.
 *
 * PURE: `assess()` takes plain rows and an anchor, touches no DB and no clock —
 * the `pi-health.assess()` / `friction.assess()` split. Only `build()` reads.
 *
 * CommonJS — NEURO backend convention.
