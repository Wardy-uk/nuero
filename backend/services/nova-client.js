 * NOVA client — NEURO's hands inside the support platform.

 * NOVA owns the Jira queue, the escalation log and the account context; NEURO
 * owns the conversation Nick is actually having. So "escalate NT-28061, the AM
 * says they're at renewal" has to cross the gap. It goes DIRECT (decided in the
 * BA, 15 Aug 2026) rather than via n8n — one less moving part between a spoken
 * sentence and a Jira write.
 *
 * Auth: NOVA has no machine-token path. It is JWT-only, and its middleware
 * re-reads the role from the users table on every request, so NEURO needs a real
 * NOVA account rather than a shared secret. We log in, cache the JWT, and
 * re-authenticate once on a 401 — tokens expire and the alternative is an
 * escalation failing at the moment Nick asks for it.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: the username on that NOVA account is what lands in the Jira comment
 * as "Escalated by ...", and the assignee reads it. Name the account for how it
 * should read to them, not for what it technically is.
