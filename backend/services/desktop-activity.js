/**
 * What the laptop is doing — the one signal NEURO could not get any other way.
 *
 * Nick, 31 Aug 2026: "not working on my laptop (can SARA detect that?) and not
 * in a meeting — suggest a task. Too long coding (can SARA detect I've been in
 * VS Code for 4 hours?) — suggest a task."
 *
 * Both answers are yes, and neither is reachable from anything NEURO already
 * has: the phone knows where he is, the watch knows whether he is sitting, the
 * calendar knows whether a meeting is running, and NONE of them can tell working
 * from not-working, or four hours of one job from four hours of twelve. A small
 * Windows-side reporter posts a sample every couple of minutes and this is where
 * it lands.
 *
 * ── The privacy line, and it is not negotiable ───────────────────────────────
 * ⚠ The reporter sends the FOREGROUND PROCESS NAME and nothing else. Never the
 * window title, never a file path, never a URL, never keystrokes. A VS Code
 * title carries the file and the workspace; a browser title carries the page;
 * an Outlook title carries the SUBJECT LINE of whatever is open, which on this
 * machine means customer names, ticket subjects and, on a bad day, the contents
 * of a disciplinary folder. "Code" is enough to answer both of Nick's questions
 * and cannot leak any of that. `sanitiseApp()` enforces it server-side too, so a
 * future reporter that gets careless is truncated here rather than trusted.
 *
 * ⚠ A LOCKED session reports `locked` and no app at all. What he had open before
 * walking away is not something to keep a record of.
 *
 * ── Storage ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A bounded ring buffer in `agent_state`, following `focus_session_history` and
 * `one_to_one_moves` rather than adding a table. This is disposable state — "what
 * is he doing lately" — not a record: nothing needs to query it by anything but
 * recency, a missed hour matters to nobody, and a schema migration on the live DB
 * is a bigger risk than the query convenience is worth. At one sample every two
 * minutes, `MAX_SAMPLES` is a little over twelve hours, which is comfortably more
 * than any run worth reporting.
 *
 * PURE where it judges: `currentRun()` and `assessDesk()` take plain arrays and a
 * clock, so every threshold pins without a database or a Windows box.
 *
 * CommonJS — NEURO backend convention.

 *  2. Worse, `currentRun` walks one list looking for CONTIGUITY. Interleave two
 *     hosts and the other machine's sample lands mid-run in a different app and
 *     ends it. Every run length would read short, with nothing logged and no
 *     error anywhere — which is precisely the failure this feature caught in
 *     RescueTime, where 0.16h was reported against a measured 8.21h day.
 *
