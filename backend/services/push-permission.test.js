/**
 * The notification prompt is never raised on launch.
 *
 * `usePushSubscription` used to call `Notification.requestPermission()` as soon
 * as the PIN was accepted, which puts the browser's ONE-SHOT dialog in front of
 * someone who opened the app to write down a thought. On iOS a denial is close
 * to permanent, so asking at the wrong moment is the single most expensive thing
 * this app can do — and it is invisible in every test that does not run on a
 * phone, because node has no `Notification`.
 *
 * So this asserts the SOURCE, the same way `widget-source.test.js` and the
 * `await describe(` pin work: the failure is syntactic and silent, and the only
 * other thing that would catch it is Nick's phone.
 *
 * ⚠ With a POSITIVE CONTROL. A scan that quietly stopped matching would pass by
 * absence, which is how a green suite once proved nothing at all about a bypass
 * (`meeting_alert` — a string that code path never sent).
