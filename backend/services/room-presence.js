/**
 * Which room in the house Nick is in.
 *
 * The BLE room sensors push to the SARA backend (:3005 on this same Pi), which
 * holds the fingerprint profiles and does the classification. NEURO reads that
 * the way it reads Home Assistant: as a SENSOR FEED, not as a second opinion.
 *
 * ⚠ That distinction is the one `sara/backend/src/state/inference.js` was
 * retired for. SARA keeps its TRANSPORT half; what it must never do is decide
 * things about Nick's day. A room reading is a measurement — the same kind of
 * fact as "the phone says he is home" — and NEURO remains the only place that
 * reasons about what it MEANS. Nothing here ranks, gates or suggests.
 *
 * ⚠ NEVER ASSERTS A ROOM IT WAS NOT TOLD. The classifier already refuses three
 * ways (uncalibrated, no match, too close to call) and every one of those
 * arrives here as `known: false` with the reason intact. An unreachable SARA is
 * the fourth. A confident wrong room is far worse than no room: this is meant
 * to feed automation, and "he is in the bedroom" turns lights on above someone.
 *
 * ⚠ IT TRACKS THE WATCH, NOT NICK. Proven live on 31 Aug 2026: he showered
 * while the watch sat on a bedroom surface and it reported `bedroom` with full
 * confidence for eight minutes. The reading is honest about what it measured —
 * `subject: 'watch'` — so nothing downstream can quietly promote it to a claim
 * about where the man is.
 *
 * CommonJS — NEURO backend convention.
