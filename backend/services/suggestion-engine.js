/**
 * Suggestion Engine — execution-first action suggestions from Focus items.
 *
 * Philosophy: "Do it" not "plan to do it".
 * Suggestions navigate the user to real actions, not task creation.
 *
 * Action types:
 *   - open_ticket       → navigate to Jira ticket
 *   - open_task         → navigate to top overdue task in TodoPanel
 *   - open_email        → navigate to inbox
 *   - open_standup      → navigate to standup
 *   - open_meeting_prep → navigate to meeting prep
 *   - draft_reply       → (future: open draft composer)
 *
 * A navigation action gets its OWN type per destination. The meeting-prep nudge
 * spent months reusing `open_task` with `navigate: 'meeting-prep'` in the
 * payload, and since the presenter keys on the type, every one of them rendered
 * as "Open tasks — jump to your task list": six cards on the approval screen,
 * identical above their reason line, all naming a destination they did not go
 * to. The destination is the entire content of a navigation card.
 *
 * Each suggestion returns a navigation target so the frontend
 * can immediately move the user to the right place.

// The dedupe below has only ever read PENDING actions, on the stated grounds
// that "navigation actions are repeatable — the user should always have a
// 'Do it' option available". That is true of a shortcut and false of an
// actuator, and `draft_reply` is an actuator: approving it spends a model call,
// writes the words, and queues a `reply_email` for the second gate.
//
// So the moment Nick approved one it left the pending set, the email was still
// urgent, and the very next `/api/focus` call — every Focus load, every agent
// loop, every briefing — generated the identical card again. Measured on the
// live DB: ONE email (Simon Greenhalgh, "Udemny") accounts for 1,168
// superseded, 6 executed and 2 rejected `draft_reply` rows since 14 August. Six
// separate approvals, six paid drafts, and two `reply_email` actions still
// sitting pending for the same message. The card reappearing was the visible
// half of a loop that was also quietly duplicating an outbound send path.
//
// ⚠ WHAT IS REPEATABLE IS `action-presenter`'s CALL, never a list of type names
// here — the same rule that already keeps `navigationExpiry`, the Actions
// queue, `bulk-reject` and `state-of-play` agreeing on what "leaves the
// building" means. NAVIGATE stays repeatable; everything else is offered once

// more — the only honest thing left to do with either is reject it, which is
// work the screen was creating for itself.
//

//   1. The payload names a moment (a meeting start) and it has passed.
//   2. It was raised on an earlier day. "Now" is the entire premise of a
//      shortcut, so a shortcut does not survive the day it was raised on.
//
// What counts as navigation is `action-presenter`'s call, never a list of type
// names kept here — the same rule that keeps three places agreeing on what
// "leaves the building" means. Writes and outbound are untouched: a drafted
// reply or a queued chase is still worth approving next week.
