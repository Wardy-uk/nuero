 * It is not a second decision engine. `decision-engine` stays the one place

 * context re-ranks it. This layer adds no candidates, changes no ranking, and
 * must never be the reason something is hidden that the gate would have shown.

 * knew what it was about, and a dismissal was indistinguishable from a snooze.
 *
 * ── The split ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Everything that JUDGES is pure and takes its clock as an argument — the
 * `pi-health.assess()` / `state-of-play.assess()` split. The rules are the
