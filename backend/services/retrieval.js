/**
 * Unified retrieval — keyword, semantic and temporal search over the vault,
 * fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).
 *
 * ── Scope is a promise, not a filter on one source (Phase 4) ────────────────
 * `scope` used to be applied inside `keywordSearch` ONLY. Semantic results were
 * never checked against it, and semantic carries the HIGHEST fusion weight
 * (1.2) — so asking for `folder:Meetings` reliably returned notes from outside
 * Meetings, ranked above the ones inside it. A scope that silently does not
 * hold is worse than no scope: it is a claim about what was searched.
 *
 * Scope is now enforced in three places, deliberately redundantly: inside each
 * source where it can be applied cheaply, again on every source's output, and
 * once more after fusion. The last one is the guarantee — a source added later
 * cannot leak past it by forgetting.
 *
 * ── Ranking must see the whole permitted set ────────────────────────────────
 * `keywordSearch` used to stop walking once it had collected `maxResults * 2`
 * files, in filesystem order. So the answer was "the first N matches the
 * directory listing happened to yield", not "the best N matches", and a note
 * late in the walk could not outrank a weak one early in it however well it
 * matched. The walk now scores everything permitted and sorts afterwards; only
 * an explicit, REPORTED cap bounds it.
 *
 * ── Depth ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The walk was capped at depth 4, which silently removed whole subtrees while
 * they went on looking perfectly searchable. The bound is now generous and,
 * when hit, is REPORTED rather than swallowed.
 *
 * ── Completeness is reported, never inferred from the count ────────────────
 * `searchWithHealth` returns `health.truncated` / `truncationReasons` /
 * `keywordComplete` / `temporalComplete`, drawn from what the WALK did — a
 * missing vault, a depth limit, a file-scan cap, a bounded scoped-semantic
 * pass. A zero-result search that read everything and a zero-result search
 * that read nothing look identical from the outside, and only one of them is
 * evidence about the vault. No consumer may use the result count as a proxy.
 *
 * ── Available is not the same claim as complete ────────────────────────────
 * `semanticAvailable` only ever meant "the query embedded and the index had
 * rows". It said nothing about whether the index holds the VAULT — and it could
 * not, because the inventory walked to depth 4 while this file walked to 12, so
 * deep notes were permanently unindexed and every search over them came back
 * confident and thin. `health.semanticCoverage*` is the second question, asked
 * of `embeddings.getCoverage()` (durable, measured by the rebuild, never walked
 * on the search path), and an incomplete index makes the whole answer
 * incomplete even when the provider is perfectly healthy.
 *
 * CommonJS — NEURO backend convention.
