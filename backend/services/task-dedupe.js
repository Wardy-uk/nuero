/**
 * Task de-duplication — NEURO tasks vs Microsoft (Planner / To Do).
 *
 * NEURO owns tasks (13 Aug 2026) but Microsoft owns its own, so `parseVaultTodos`
 * deliberately merges Microsoft lines in WITHOUT deduping them — the DB-task merge
 * only ever suppressed Master Todo and Daily lines. That is correct as far as it
 * goes and it leaves a real hole: the same action written twice, once by Nick in
 * To Do and once by a meeting promotion into NEURO, shows up as two tasks.
 *
 * `dedupe_key` cannot close it. It is a normalised-text UNIQUE key, so it matches
 * only re-imports of the SAME wording. Measured on the live vault: Planner holds
 * "Succession plan" and NEURO #58 holds "Build succession plan — cover for HoTS and
 * emerging team leads…". Same work, no shared key, and no amount of normalising
 * gets one to the other.
 *
 * So this is a SUGGESTER, not a merger. It ranks pairs and hands them to Nick side
 * by side; nothing is ever linked without him saying so. Two reasons that is not
 * timidity: the populations are small enough that reviewing is cheap (16 Microsoft
 * against ~159 NEURO), and a wrong auto-merge hides a real task behind an unrelated
 * one — silently, and in the one place he goes to find out what he has to do.
 *
 * Matching is deterministic: token overlap weighted by inverse document frequency
 * over the two task lists. No model call, so it is instant, free, identical every
 * run and works with the Pi offline. IDF is what makes it usable on Nick's corpus
 * specifically — "review", "support" and "customer" appear in dozens of his tasks
 * and carry almost no evidence, while "succession" or "sandford" appear once or
 * twice and nearly identify a task on their own. An unweighted overlap ranks the
 * common words equally and buries the real pairs.
 *
 * The top half is PURE — it takes plain arrays and returns plain objects, so the
 * ranking (which is the product) is testable without a DB, a vault or a clock,
 * the same split as pi-health.assess() and state-of-play.assess().

// that side is `task-store.dedupeKey` — the first 80 characters of normalised
// text, UNIQUE — which matches a re-import of the same wording and nothing else.
// So two captures of one commitment, worded differently, are two rows for ever.
//
// Measured over the 143 open NEURO tasks on the Pi (10,153 pairs):
//
//   1.000  "Prepare MyAudience vs iMail price comparisons (for Chris -> SLT)"
//          "Nick to prepare price comparisons between MyAudience and iMail..."
//   1.000  "Consult Annabelle for insights"

 * Score arbitrary texts against the open task list. PURE apart from the tasks

 * disagree, and the disagreement would surface as VANTAGE creating a duplicate
 * of a task Planner already holds.
 *
 * Three differences from rankCandidates, all intentional:
 *
 * - **BOTH populations are searched.** This is the one that matters. The task
 *   store and the Microsoft mirror are separate lists joined only by the links
 *   below, and on 20 Aug 2026 there were no links at all: 163 tasks, zero with
 *   an `ms_id`, while eighteen live Planner items sat in the vault. Searching
 *   the task store alone answered "nothing exists for this action" for actions
 *   that were sitting on Mel's board with a due date on them. An absent link is
 *   not an absent task.
 * - Tasks ALREADY linked to Microsoft are still scored. rankCandidates excludes
 *   them because their question is answered; here a plan action mapping onto a
 *   task that is already merged with the board is the *best* possible answer,
 *   not a disqualified one.
 * - The IDF is built over every candidate and the queries together, so a word
 *   common to all of them ("review", "process") is correctly cheap.
 *
 * texts:    [{ id, text }] — id is the caller's, echoed back untouched.
 * tasks:    NEURO task rows.
 * msTasks:  the Microsoft mirror — [{ ms_id, text, due_date, source }].
 *
 * Each match carries `kind`, because what the caller does next differs: a
 * `neuro` match is linked to, a `microsoft` match has no NEURO task yet and one
 * has to be made and merged.

// vault parser and the completion push both read, so there is exactly one place
// that answers "is this linked". Only the REJECTIONS need somewhere to live, and
// they go in agent_state rather than a table: a rejection is a pair of ids and a
// date, nothing queries it by anything but the pair, and a schema migration on the
// live DB is a bigger risk than the query convenience is worth (same call as
// standup-session).
//
// Not remembering them is what would make this feature unusable: 2,544 pairs are
// scored every run, so a pair Nick has already rejected would come back every
// single time he opened the screen.

/**
 * Nick says these two ARE the same task.
 *
 * One NEURO row is what NEURO counts, ranks and completes; the Microsoft line
 * stops listing separately, and ticking the task pushes completion to Graph.
 * Nothing is deleted in Microsoft — the task stays there, and stays open until
 * it is actually finished.
 *
 * ── Which wording leads ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `lead` decides whose WORDS the surviving row carries, and nothing else — both
 * records still exist, NEURO still owns the count and the completion push
 * either way. The default is `neuro`, which is the old behaviour and usually
 * right: the NEURO wording is the fuller one (*"Share the action plan planner
 * with the team once it is in a workable state"* against Planner's *"Communicate
 * the action plan to all teams"*). `microsoft` is for the other case — when the
 * board's wording is the one Nick's team is reading and the two should agree.
 *
 * ⚠ Adoption is a ONE-OFF COPY, not a subscription. Nothing re-applies it when
 * the Planner card is later renamed, and the card says so; storing a `lead`
 * flag that only something in the future would honour is a reader waiting for a
 * writer, which is how the Jira cache came to state a seven-week-old snapshot
 * as current fact.
 *
 * ⚠ Adoption NEVER blanks what NEURO already had. An absent Planner due date is
 * "the board does not track one", not "clear the date Nick set" — the two look
 * identical in a null and only one of them is a decision.
 *
 * ⚠ The link stands even when the adoption fails. `updateTask` refuses a text
 * that would collide with another task's dedupe key, and the pair being the
 * same task is a separate fact from whose wording won — throwing the link away
 * over a rename would make Nick answer the duplicate question twice.
