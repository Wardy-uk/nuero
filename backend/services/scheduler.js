// ── Missed-run catch-up ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `node-cron` is in-process and has NO catch-up: if the process is not running
// at 02:30, that night's job simply never happens and nothing says so. Measured
// on the Pi: the nightly sweep ran 9 times in 45 nights and the weekly hygiene
// pass 4 times in 7 Fridays, while the 22:00 rollup showed 111 runs and the Pi
// itself had 34 days of uptime. So it was never downtime — it was `neuro-backend`
// restarting (49 restarts, mostly deploys; two or three Claude sessions deploy a
// day) and each restart silently eating whatever was due while it was gone.
//
// Every job that IS reliable already has a startup fallback — capture drain,
// embeddings, imports, Plaud, MS Tasks, calendar. Every 02:30 and Friday job
// lacked one. This is that pattern, generalised: stamp the run date into
// `agent_state`, and on boot run anything whose slot has already passed today
// and whose stamp is not today's.
//
// Deliberately: a job missed YESTERDAY is not run today. Catch-up means "this
// slot has passed and was missed", not "replay history" — a week of missed
// sweeps firing at once on a Monday boot is a worse failure than the one being
// fixed.
