/**
 * The off-site copy (#59).
 *
 * Local backups are watched above; this watches the copy that leaves the
 * building, because the failure mode of off-site backup is silence — it stops
 * in March and you find out in November, when it is the only thing that would
 * have helped.
 *
 * Reads the status file `backup-offsite.sh` writes on EVERY exit path, so an
 * absent file means the job has never completed, not that it succeeded quietly.
 * Three distinct answers, and keeping them apart is the whole point:
 *
 *   unconfigured — the B2 remote does not exist yet. That is the NORMAL state
 *                  until the key is created, so it is `info`, not a warning.
 *                  Same rule as state-of-play's `never` (#65): unknown is not
 *                  broken, and a board that opens with false warnings is one
 *                  nobody reads by week two.
 *   failed       — it ran and could not finish. Critical: it is trying and
 *                  cannot, which is the state that needs a person.
 *   ok but old   — it stopped being run at all.
 *
 * Off-Linux (Nick's Windows dev box) there is no /mnt at all, so a missing file
 * there must not manufacture an issue — same degradation rule as pi-health.
