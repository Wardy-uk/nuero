/**
 * The FreeReps iOS app's wire API, served by NEURO itself (#40).
 *
 *   POST /api/v1/ingest/  — HealthKit payload from the phone
 *   GET  /api/v1/me       — the app's "test connection" probe
 *   GET  /api/v1/version  — served for completeness; the real server has it
 *
 * These paths are NOT chosen by us — they are what the app hard-codes, so they
 * are fixed by the client and cannot be moved under a nicer prefix.
 *
 * ── Why this is unauthenticated ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The app has no way to send a credential. Its entire config model is host,
 * port, useHTTPS, testMode, testHost, testPort and backfillMonths — there is no
 * token field, no header, and no path component to smuggle one through. Real
 * FreeReps solves this with Tailscale identity (tsnet) at the transport layer.
 *
 * NEURO is not a tsnet server, so the equivalent guard here is the network: the
 * request must come from the tailnet's CGNAT range or from loopback. That is a
 * real boundary — the Pi's 3001 is not published to the internet — but it is
 * weaker than a token, so it is stated plainly rather than implied, and the
 * route accepts writes to ONE table and can do nothing else.
 *
 * `routes/health.js`'s own /ingest keeps its Bearer token and is untouched; this
 * is a second door for a client that cannot knock.

// ── Source guard ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A source-IP check is NOT sufficient here, and getting this wrong exposed an
// unauthenticated write endpoint to the public internet for one deploy.
//
// pi5 already runs `tailscale serve` with **Funnel ON** for
// https://pi5.tailecb90f.ts.net → 127.0.0.1:3001. Funnel means the whole
// internet, not the tailnet. Everything under /api was fine because it needs the
// PIN; these routes cannot take a PIN, so they need their own answer.
//
// The trap: Tailscale proxies BOTH tailnet and Funnel traffic from 127.0.0.1, so
// "is the peer address local or 100.64/10" cannot tell a colleague's browser
// from a stranger's. Trusting loopback let Funnel straight through.
//
// So this fails CLOSED and identifies the caller from what Tailscale adds:
//   - `Tailscale-Funnel-Request` is set on Funnel traffic  → always refused.
//   - `Tailscale-User-Login` is added by Serve for tailnet peers → accepted.
//   - A direct connection from 100.64.0.0/10 (not via Serve) → accepted.
//   - Bare loopback is NOT trusted by default, because that is exactly what a
//     Funnel request looks like if the header is ever absent. Set
//     APPLE_HEALTH_ALLOW_LOOPBACK=1 to curl it on the Pi.
