/**
 * Completing a Microsoft-owned attention card, over real HTTP.
 *
 * The service suite proves `lifecycle.act` hands the push back. It says nothing
 * about whether anybody PICKS IT UP — and the whole bug was a completion that
 * stopped one layer short of the work while reporting itself as done. So this
 * drives the actual route and asserts Graph was actually called with the id the
 * card was carrying.
 *
 * A green service suite says nothing about routing; a green routing suite says
 * nothing about a handler that awaits nothing.
