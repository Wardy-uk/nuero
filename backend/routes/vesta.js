/**
 * VESTA — the shared home surface, mounted at /api/v and EXEMPT from the PIN
 * middleware. Served at its own address (vesta.nickward.co.uk).
 *
 *   POST /api/v/login    { username, pin } → a signed session token
 *   GET  /api/v/home     → everything this account may see, in one call
 *   POST /api/v/tasks    { text, for } → add a task
 *   POST /api/v/kitchen  { place, name } → something went in
 *   POST /api/v/kitchen/used { place, name } → something got eaten
 *
 * ⚠ THIS IS PUBLIC. pi5 runs Tailscale Funnel, so an auth exemption publishes
 * these routes to the internet, not merely to the tailnet. That is the point —
 * Nick's partner has no NEURO PIN and must never have one.
 *
 * Three rules hold the boundary, and all three are enforced HERE rather than in
 * the page:
 *
 *  • EVERY read is gated on a SCOPE the account actually holds, and scopes
 *    default closed. An account created before VESTA sees exactly what it saw
 *    yesterday: its own submissions and nothing else.
 *  • THE CALENDAR IS REDACTED IN THE SERVICE. A work subject never enters this
 *    file, so no handler can leak one by forgetting to.
 *  • THE ADMIN HALF IS NOT HERE. Creating accounts and granting scopes lives on
 *    /api/capture-links behind the PIN. An account that could widen its own
 *    scope would make the whole model decorative.
 *
 * ⚠ The mount is `/v/` and the exemption tests `startsWith('/v/')`, one letter
 * from `/v1/` (the FreeReps health wire) and deliberately not `/v`. Same care as
 * `/c/` versus `/capture-links`.
