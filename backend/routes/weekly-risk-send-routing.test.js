/**
 * The in-place approval routes actually resolve, and the send stays one path.
 *
 * A green service suite says nothing about routing: Express matches in
 * REGISTRATION order, and a literal path registered after a sibling
 * parameterised one is read as that parameter instead — which is how
 * `/triage/feedback` came to be parsed as an email id (#70).
 *
 * The second test is the one that matters most. Approving from the weekly risk
 * panel must remain the SAME gate the Actions queue uses — the same queued
 * action, the same approve route, the same executor. If this router ever grows
 * a route that sends, there are two ways for a report to reach the manager
 * assessing Nick's PIP, only one of which is gated, and that is precisely the
 * shape the two-gate rule exists to prevent.
