/**
 * Gate 4 — meeting prep must show its evidence.
 *
 * This is prep for a room Nick is about to walk into with a real colleague, and
 * the material is an AUTOMATED PARSE of 232 meeting notes whose own service
 * notes say some rows are misparses. So the standard is not "is it useful", it
 * is:
 *
 *   * every commitment says WHERE IT CAME FROM;
 *   * nothing asserts that a person failed, ignored or promised anything —
 *     it reports what a note recorded, and lets Nick weigh it;
 *   * a source that could not be READ is named, never rendered as "nothing
 *     there". "Hope owes you nothing" and "I couldn't check what Hope owes you"
 *     are opposite facts, and only one of them is good news.
 *
 * Asserted against the SOURCE, because `_buildPrep` is a private function
 * reached only through routes that need Graph, a vault and a live DB — and the
 * rules here are structural, not behavioural.
