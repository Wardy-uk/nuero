/**
 * Escalations — the desk surface for "this ticket needs to jump the queue".
 *
 * Nick gets asked for escalations verbally and in Teams, usually with a ticket
 * number and a reason that never makes it anywhere durable. This is the form:
 * type the key, see what the ticket actually is, say why, done.
 *
 * NOVA owns every rule (internal-only comment, tighten-only due date,
 * raise-only priority) and every write. This route is a thin, honest pipe —
 * it deliberately re-implements none of that logic, because two copies of a
 * safety rule is one copy too many.
 *
 * Unlike the chat tool, submitting here is NOT queued for approval. The chat
 * tool queues because SAiM is acting on an inferred intention; here Nick has
 * typed the ticket key, read the detail back and pressed the button. A second
 * approval step for a form he just filled in is friction, not safety — so the
 * UI confirms what will change before it posts, and that confirmation IS the gate.

/**
 * How far back the urgency arm asks NOVA's log — #104.
 *
 * This was 90 days, and a 90-day window is a SILENT cap: an urgency escalation
 * older than that on a still-open ticket simply stopped being badged, and
 * "still open 91 days after being escalated" is precisely the ticket Nick would
 * most want to see. That is the fifth instance of this species here (calendar
 * `$top=50`, the 1,958-key JQL, Planner `$top=200`, the escalation `isLast`).
 *
 * Measured before changing it: over the log's ENTIRE life it holds exactly TWO
 * manual escalations, both raised on 15 Aug 2026, so the incidence of the bug
 * today is zero — widening 90 → 3650 days moves 1,935 rows to 2,352 and finds
 * the same 2. So this is not a fix for a live symptom; it retires the cap
 * before the population is old enough to hit it, which costs ~400 extra rows on
 * a route that is not hot.
 *
 * Ten years is "the whole log" rather than a tuned number — a window nobody can
 * age out of is the only kind that never needs revisiting. And the response
 * NAMES it either way, because a number that cannot state its own edge is the
 * actual defect: honest beats wide.
