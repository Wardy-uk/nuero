 * "This isn't a must-do today."
 *
 * ── Why it goes through the attention lifecycle ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * The lane had no way to disagree with it at all. Membership is recomputed on
 * every read (`moscow === 'must' || overdue || dueToday || priority high`), so
 * there was nothing to override, and the indirect levers do not work either:
 * dropping the MoSCoW leaves `overdue` carrying `needsToday` on its own, so the
 * only exit for an overdue task was to move its due date — a lie about when it
 * was committed to — or to abandon it.
 *
 * The rest of NEURO already solved this properly. `attention_records` keeps
 * "I've seen it", "not now" and "not mine" apart, carries a REASON on a
 * deferral, and `friction.js` reads those reasons back as evidence about the
 * WORK (a task put off three times for `too-big` is a finding). So this reuses
 * that rather than adding a second suppression map — and because the key is
 * `todo:<slug of text>`, the same key the decision engine uses, "not today"
 * here is the same statement as deferring the task on the Now page. Two stores
 * would let one surface contradict the other about a decision made once.
 *
 * ⚠ The record is created HERE, at the moment Nick decides — never on the read
 * path. `GET /api/todos` is polled; opening a record per lane row per poll
 * would write continuously to say nothing, and the honest position is that a
 * task has no lifecycle record until somebody has an opinion about it.
 *
 * ⚠ Only DEFER is offered, not dismiss. "Not today" is a statement about
 * timing; "never show me this" is a statement about the task, and the task is
 * still open and still owed. Conflating them is how work disappears from the
 * one place Nick looks to find what he owes.
