 * Apple Calendar and Reminders ingest, pushed from Scriptable on Nick's phone.

 * POST /api/apple/reminders  { reminders: [...] }
 * GET  /api/apple/status     — when the phone last pushed, and whether it is stale
 *
 * ⚠ NO auth exemption, deliberately. The FreeReps health route needed one only
 * because that app's config has no credential field at all; Scriptable can set

 * endpoint to the internet (Funnel is on) for no reason whatsoever.

// ── Why there is no server-side pull here ────────────────────────────────────
//
// Tried and REMOVED, 3 Sep 2026. A CalDAV client against caldav.icloud.com was
// built, tested and run against Nick's real account, and the answer was that the
// data is not there:
//
//   · CALENDARS. iCloud CalDAV exposes only the six iCloud calendars, which hold
//     dormant history — birthdays from 2003, a lapsed BSAC renewal, series that
//     ended in 2020, and EIGHT events in the whole of 2026. Nick's actual diary
//     lives in ward.nickj@gmail.com and 22 other Google/subscribed calendars that
//     exist on the DEVICE. iCloud has never held them.
//   · REMINDERS. The list comes back named "Reminders ⚠️" containing exactly two
//     items: "Where are my reminders?" and "The creator of this list has upgraded
//     these reminders". That is Apple's placeholder — upgraded Reminders lists are
//     deliberately not served over CalDAV.
//
// Both were measured, not assumed. So EventKit on the phone is not an awkward way
// to get this data, it is the ONLY way: it sees all 23 calendars and the real
// Reminders store, and no server-side protocol does.
//
// Which means the push below is the design, and its one real fault is worth
// fixing rather than routing around: the Scriptable script reads its API token
// from the iOS Keychain, and Keychain items written with the default
// accessibility are unreadable while the device is locked — so it works in the
// hand and never in the pocket.
//
// Do not rebuild the CalDAV client. It worked; there was nothing to read.
