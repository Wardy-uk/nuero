// SARA on the Pi — the same app as the phone.
//
// ⚠ WHAT THIS REPLACED, and why. Nick, 31 Aug 2026: "make the Pi version of
// SARA the same as phone app - same for the desktop." It was not. The kiosk had
// its own fourteen-screen registry rendering `sara/backend`'s state model,
// while the phone had thirteen rendering NEURO's own contracts, and exactly ONE
// kiosk screen (Presence) had ever read the attention feed. Two screen sets
// over two backends is the drift `AttentionSurface` and `voiceUtils` each had
// to be undone from, one level up — so there is now ONE registry
// (`sara/shared-ui/tabs.jsx`) and both shells mount it.
//
// The DESKTOP comes free: `sara/desktop-electron` loads this same frontend from
// `SARA_URL`, so it is the same app by construction rather than by a third port.
//
// ── What is still the kiosk's own, and why ──────────────────────────────────
// The screens are shared; the chrome is not, exactly as `AttentionSurface`
// splits them. The kiosk brings the provenance banner, the Exit control, and
// the two display states NEURO composes for it — clock (at home, not in this
// room) and lock (out of the house). The phone brings a PIN gate, push
// registration and a wake lock, none of which mean anything on a screen that is
// simply on and has nobody to log in.
//
// ⚠ THE KIOSK HOLDS NO NEURO CREDENTIAL. The shared views call `/api/*`
// same-origin; `sara/backend` answers its own named routes and forwards the
// rest through an ALLOWLIST (`src/routes/neuroProxy.js`), attaching the
// credential server-side. That was always the reason the two apps could not be
// one, and it turned out to be a fact about the BROWSER, not about the screens.
// Module scope so the hook's effect is not re-created on every render. Same
// origin as the SPA, so `sara/backend` answers and attaches the credential.

  // `FieldCover` wraps exactly the covered subtree, so every field inside it
