// SARA view system — the "one state, many views" registry (WS2-WP1).
//
// Protected principle 7 (charter): SARA's UI must be view-based and
// interchangeable. Screens are *representations* of the one shared state model;
// they do not own data and they are not the architecture. This module is the
// canonical list of views and the current-view default — the structural proof
// that the project is NOT hardcoded around a single home screen.
//
// The current product-alignment slice reshapes the registry around the written NEURO /
// SARA screen set while preserving the protected many-views architecture. Some screens
// are fully implemented, some are honest v0 read-only surfaces, and some remain bounded
// placeholders — but every one is backed by the same shared state/context model.
//
// This is the "view type definition" called for in the build brief, expressed in
// plain JS to match the existing converged runtime (React + Vite, no TypeScript).

// Canonical SaraView identifiers. The string value is the stable view id used in
// the registry, the router, and (later) the recommended/selected view in state.
