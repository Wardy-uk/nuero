// must look the same wherever she is; two copies would drift, which is exactly
// what happened to `voiceUtils.js` when the phone and the desktop each kept
// their own. Field itself is size-agnostic — its density is per AREA, not a
// node count — so the same file reads correctly on a 390px phone and a 1280px
// desk panel without re-tuning.

// Surface — SARA without a menu.
//
// The rest of this app is a tab strip: Nick chooses, SARA renders. This is the
// other way round. It renders GET /api/attention — ONE thing the brain decided
// is worth his attention, in the context it decided it in — and the nine views
// become places the brain routes TO rather than things to go and find.
//
// ── Presence ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// SARA is `components/Field`: the vault as a pinned noisy substrate, with her
// visible only as order arriving in it. No orb, no avatar, no face. The field
// is driven by the brain's OWN state, so the coherence on screen is the
// coherence of the read — informative before a word is read, which is what
// keeps it from being a screensaver.
//
// ── Ears ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// SARA is the voice/ears/eyes layer, and until now her own screen had neither a
// mic nor a speech toggle: talking to her meant "Show me everything" → Chat,
// i.e. going through a menu to reach the thing that exists so you don't need
// one. The mic is here, and the exchange is deliberately EPHEMERAL — one
// question, one answer, then back to the ambient state. The Chat tab owns
// conversation and history; this owns the passing question. Two surfaces
// keeping two versions of the same thread is the drift this avoids.
//
// The mic tap is also the iOS audio-unlock gesture, which is why `unlockAudio`
// is called there explicitly rather than left to whichever touch wins the race.
//
// Three things it must still get right, all of them about honesty:
//   * SILENCE IS A CORRECT ANSWER. Most of a calm day has no primary.
//   * NOTHING IS HIDDEN SILENTLY. What was gated out is named.
//   * "COULDN'T LOOK" IS NOT "NOTHING THERE" — hence `context.cannotSee`, which
//     the brain now filters to gaps that could actually have changed the answer.
