// The last reading from each room sensor. In-memory, deliberately.
//
// These are readings about RIGHT NOW with a ~3 second cadence and a 30 second
// shelf life. Persisting them would create a store whose whole content is stale
// the moment it is read back — and a stale reading that survives a restart is
// worse than no reading, because `resolveRoom` would have to distinguish
// "reported 3 seconds ago" from "reported before the last deploy" and the only
// honest answer to the second is the same as having nothing. Losing the lot on a
// restart is correct: the sensors re-report within seconds, and until they do
// the arbitration says `unknown`, which is true.
//
// ⚠ Nothing here validates that a room is one we expected. A sensor names its
// own room; an unknown name shows up as an unknown room rather than being
// dropped, because a sensor reporting under a name nobody recognises is a
// misconfiguration worth SEEING, and silently discarding it is how a Pi sits in
// a bedroom for a fortnight reporting into a hole.
