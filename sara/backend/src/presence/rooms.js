// Which room is Nick in, and what should a screen in a given room be showing?
//
// PURE. Takes the reports, the Home Assistant read and a clock; does no I/O and
// holds no state. The `pi-health.assess()` split — the rules are the product, so
// they pin without a live sensor, a live HA, or a wall to stand in front of.
//
// ── The three display states (Nick, 31 Aug 2026) ────────────────────────────
//   full    the watch is in THIS room  -> SARA, everything, on screen
//   clock   he is at home but not here -> just the clock
//   locked  he is not at home at all   -> screen off (backlight to 0)
//
// The shape matters more than it looks. The OLD design had two states and lost
// the watch STRAIGHT INTO A LOCK, which is why it "incorrectly locked SARA": a
// noisy radio cost Nick his display. Here, losing the watch costs him a clock
// face, and only geolocation — slow-moving, and a different sensor entirely —
// can lock. That is what makes the BLE layer allowed to be imperfect.
//
// ── Two rules carried in from everything else that reads a sensor ───────────
//
// ⚠ AN UNREADABLE ROOM IS NAMED, NEVER COUNTED AS EMPTY. A stale report and a
// deaf radio both mean "we could not look there", which is a different fact from
// "he is not there" — and treating them the same is exactly how the old service
// reported `away` for fifteen days from a scan that had died. Every unreadable
// room comes back in `unreadable`, with why.
//
// ⚠ UNKNOWN NEVER LOCKS. Locking is the only irreversible-feeling thing here —
// it blanks a screen Nick may be standing in front of — so it requires a
// CONFIDENT "not at home". No HA, no zone, a stale zone: all render `clock`.
// Failing towards the clock is the whole reason the middle state exists.

'use strict';

// A sensor reports every ~3s. Thirty seconds is ten missed reports: comfortably
// past a hiccup, and well inside the time it takes to walk to another room.
const SENSOR_STALE_MS = 30_000;

// How much louder a challenger must be before it takes the room off the
// incumbent. MEASURED, not picked (31 Aug 2026, Nick sat in the living room):
//
//   living-room -68..-74, kitchen -73..-76   -> gap 1-5 dB, and the WINNER
//                                               FLIPPED to the kitchen once
//   Nick actually near the kitchen           -> kitchen -66, living -83 = 17 dB
//
// So the noise between two rooms with him in one of them reaches 5 dB, while
// genuinely walking to the other room is worth 17. Six sits in that gap. Without
// it the screen alternates between full SARA and the clock while he sits still -
// the flapping the sensor layer was rebuilt to remove, reappearing one floor up
// because two medians a decibel apart is a coin toss.
const SWITCH_MARGIN_DB = 6;

// Settled in the bedroom for this long and the screen goes dark (Nick, 31 Aug
// 2026). It is a proxy for "gone to bed", so it wants to be long enough that
// fetching something from upstairs does not trigger it and short enough to be
// dark before he is asleep.
//
// ⚠ CONTINUOUS, and the clock resets on any change of room. Accumulating total
// time in a room across a whole evening would lock the screen after a few trips
// upstairs, which is not what going to bed looks like.
//
// ⚠ It inherits the watch caveat, and here it BITES: a watch left charging in
// the bedroom reads as Nick being in the bedroom, so the living-room screen
// would go dark half an hour later even with him sat in front of it. He wears it
// overnight for sleep tracking, so this should be rare — and it recovers the
// moment the watch moves. Worth knowing before blaming the lock.
