// Which room is Nick ACTUALLY in — by fingerprint, not by loudest sensor.
//
// PURE classification; the profile store is separate. No I/O, no clock.
//
// ── Why not "the loudest sensor wins" ───────────────────────────────────────
// Because it was measured wrong, twice, on 31 Aug 2026:
//
//   · pi5 (Pi 5) and pi-dev (Pi 4) have different radios. Absolute RSSI is not
//     comparable between them, so the ranking partly measured the hardware.
//   · Nick sat still in the living room with the watch on the arm shielded by
//     his own body, and the KITCHEN out-read the living room by 9 dB. A body
//     attenuates 2.4 GHz by 5-15 dB; a plasterboard wall by 3-5. His arm
//     outweighed a wall.
//
// Neither is fixable by choosing a better threshold, because neither is about
// distance. Both vanish under fingerprinting: a room is identified by the WHOLE
// PATTERN across every sensor, so "the kitchen hears me 9 dB louder than the
// living room does" stops being an error and becomes part of what the living
// room LOOKS like. A constant hardware offset appears in every profile and
// cancels; a body shadow is learned if calibration spans a few orientations.
//
// ── What a profile is ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Per room, per sensor: mean and standard deviation of RSSI and of advert rate,
// plus how many samples it rests on. Classification scores the live vector by
// summed normalised deviation and picks the nearest.
//
// ⚠ RATE AND RSSI BOTH COUNT, deliberately. Rate is robust to a turned wrist
// (measured: in-room 1.75-2.55/s against upstairs 0.10-0.40/s, a 4x gap) but
// coarse. RSSI is finer but swings 26 dB at a fixed seat. Together they
// disagree in different directions, which is what makes the combination worth
// more than either.
//
// ── Three refusals ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// ⚠ NO PROFILE, NO ANSWER. A room that has never been calibrated can never be
// inferred. Better a null than a confident wrong room driving automation.
//
// ⚠ A POOR MATCH IS `unknown`, NOT THE LEAST-BAD ROOM. Nick standing in the
// garage - a room with no profile at all - must not resolve to whichever
// bedroom scores least badly.
//
// ⚠ A NARROW WIN IS `unsure`, AND SAYS SO. Two rooms within a hair of each
// other is a coin toss; automation asking "which room" deserves to be told it
// was a close call rather than handed the winner of a tie.

'use strict';

// sensor) before the whole match is called poor. Generous: a false `unknown`
