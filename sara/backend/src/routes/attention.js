 * GET  /api/attention              — the kiosk's read of NEURO's attention feed
 * GET  /api/attention/records      — every OPEN record, so a legacy screen holding
 *                                    only a decision-engine item id can find the
 *                                    canonical record to act on
 * POST /api/attention/records/:id/act — acknowledge | defer | dismiss | complete | start
 *
 * The read half of this is a passthrough. So is the write half: the kiosk sends
 * an ACTION and NEURO decides what it means. Nothing here interprets, maps or
 * substitutes one action for another.
 *
 * A PASSTHROUGH, and deliberately nothing more. It stores nothing, ranks
 * nothing, and re-words nothing: the payload is returned verbatim, exactly as
 * `neuroCapture` forwards a capture rather than keeping a copy.
 *
 * ⚠ This is the seam where `sara/backend` last grew a second brain.
 * `state/inference.js` was retired for computing its own activity enum,
 * confidence model and recommended-view map from SEEDED inputs — a second
 * opinion about data that did not exist. NEURO owns the attention decision now
 * (`docs/attention-contract.md`), so anything here that re-ranked or re-phrased
 * would recreate that mistake with the same shape and a different name.
 *
 * ⚠ It is also NOT part of `neuroSnapshot`'s bounded poll set. That set feeds
 * the State Engine, and folding attention into the shared model would make the
 * kiosk's own state a competing account of what deserves Nick's attention. The
 * screen reads this directly, so there is exactly one account and it is NEURO's.
 *
 * Every failure is NAMED and carries `available: false`. A blank feed and an
 * unreadable one are different facts and only one of them is good news — the
 * rule the whole provenance block exists to enforce.
 *
 * CommonJS only.

  // ⚠ This route replaces `POST /api/actions/focus/done`, which proxied
  // `/api/focus/action-done` — a route that logs a COMPLETED OUTCOME and
  // dismisses the item. The kiosk's "Done" button therefore recorded work as
  // finished and hid the card, and its "Defer" POSTed `/dismiss`, so "not now"
  // and "not mine" were one gesture. Both are the desktop bug, one surface
  // along, and both are gone.
  //
  // ⚠ It is a PASSTHROUGH and must stay one. The action is forwarded verbatim
  // and NEURO decides what it means — an unknown action comes back as NEURO's
  // 400, never as a local guess. Substituting one action for another here is
  // precisely how `focus/done` came to mean something nobody asked for.
  //
  // ⚠ A write is NOT given the read's `200 + available:false` treatment. The
  // feed is POLLED, so a non-2xx there lands in a generic "something broke"
  // branch that cannot name the reason; a write is a deliberate press of a
  // button, and reporting a refusal as a success is how a card looks acted-on
  // when nothing happened.
