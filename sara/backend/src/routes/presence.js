// GET /api/presence — compact "are you here?" signal for the SARA auto-lock.
//
// The SARA frontend lock logic polls this (small payload) rather than the full
// /api/state, so the wall display can cheaply ask "should I lock?" on a tight interval.
//
// SARA_PRESENCE_SOURCE picks WHICH question this route answers. The two modes are
// different claims, not two ways of measuring one thing, so the mode is named in the
// response rather than left implicit:
//
//   'watch' (default) — "are you AT THE DESK?", desk-level, Apple Watch BLE proximity.
//   'home'            — "are you IN THE HOUSE?", house-level, the phone's Home Assistant
//                       zone. Deliberately WIDER: at home but in another room reads as
//                       present, so SARA stays unlocked while you are anywhere in the
//                       house and locks only once the phone leaves the home zone.
//
// Source priority in 'watch' mode:
//   1. Watch BLE presence service — the on-Pi watch-presence service writes a JSON
//      status file (present/away via the Apple Watch IRK + RSSI). This is the primary,
//      desk-level signal. Used when the file is present and FRESH.
//   2. Home Assistant proximity — fallback when the watch service isn't reporting
//      (file missing/stale), preserving the original HA-proximity behaviour.
//
// In 'home' mode the watch file is not read at all — a fresh watch report saying "away"
// (you left the desk) must not lock a display you asked to stay unlocked while you are
// in the house. Home is decided by the HA LOCATION slot (a person/device_tracker whose
// state is a zone), with the proximity slot as a fallback. A custom zone ("Office",
// "Gym") is NOT home: only the literal `home` zone is.
//
// `away` is the single boolean the client acts on:
//   true  -> SARA may auto-lock (you appear to have left)
//   false -> you're present (and the client may auto-unlock)
//   null  -> unknown (no source available). The client MUST NOT auto-lock on null —
//            only the idle-timeout safety net should fire — so a blind signal can never
//            lock you out.
