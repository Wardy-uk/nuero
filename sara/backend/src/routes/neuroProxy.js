/**
 * The kiosk's door onto NEURO — `/api/*` for the paths the shared app needs.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY THIS EXISTS. Nick, 31 Aug 2026: "make the Pi version of SARA the same
 * as the phone app." Every phone view talks DIRECTLY to NEURO with a PIN in the
 * browser's localStorage. The kiosk cannot: it is an always-on, unauthenticated
 * touchscreen on a desk, and a NEURO credential sitting in that browser is the
 * one thing the whole `sara/backend` passthrough design exists to avoid. So the
 * credential stays here and the same views reach NEURO through this route.
 *
 * ⚠ IT IS A NAMED DOOR, NOT AN OPEN PROXY, and the ALLOWLIST is the entire
 * safety model. `neuroCapture` established the rule: a kind not in the table is
 * refused LOCALLY rather than passed through. A blanket `/api/*` forward would
 * put every NEURO route — `/api/capture-links` (VESTA accounts and PINs),
 * `/api/microsoft/auth`, the Notion token, `/api/actions/:id/approve` (which
 * SENDS EMAIL) — behind an unauthenticated screen on the desk, reachable by
 * anything on the tailnet, since `server.js` binds 0.0.0.0.
 *
 * The list below is derived from what the shared views actually call. Adding to
 * it is a decision; nothing gets in by being convenient.
 *
 * ⚠ NOTHING OUTBOUND IS REACHABLE. `/api/actions` is deliberately ABSENT even
 * though it looks like a natural fit: approving an action there can send email
 * as Nick, book a meeting with real attendees, or push a chase to a direct
 * report. `action-presenter`'s "leaves the building" test is the rule, and this
 * side of the door is where it is applied. The attention feed's own act
 * passthrough (`routes/attention.js`) stays the only write path onto a card,
 * because its verbs are bounded by the contract.
 *
 * ⚠ It stores nothing, re-words nothing and interprets nothing — the upstream
 * status and body are returned as they arrive. A proxy that rewrites a refusal
 * into a success is how a screen comes to look like it worked.
 *
 * CommonJS only.
