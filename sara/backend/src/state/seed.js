// SARA State Engine — seed inputs (WS1-WP1).
//
// HARDCODED domain inputs. WS1 is explicitly allowed to use hardcoded inputs: the
// goal of this work package is a real contract + real engine, not real
// integrations. Every domain is stamped `source: 'seed'` so any consumer can tell
// the data is not live yet.
//
// This is the swappable layer. A later work package replaces each provider with
// one that reads the real source (Jira queue, do-next, people notes, vault) — the
// engine (stateEngine.js) and the contract (contract.js) do not change. Each
// provider must return one domain object conforming to that domain's backbone in
// contract.js DOMAIN_CONTRACTS.
//
// CommonJS only.
