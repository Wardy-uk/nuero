# run at login by install-autostart.ps1.

#   input. These RSSI numbers are tuned to Nick's desk; a very different spot may need a
#   re-tune (WATCH_RSSI_NEAR / WATCH_RSSI_NEEDED).

# 3. The Electron window is deliberately NOT started here.
#
# ⚠ IT USED TO BE, and it fought the desktop shortcut. This script launched
# Electron with SARA_URL=http://localhost:3005/ (the kiosk build), while the
# shortcut asks for https://sara.nickward.co.uk (the phone build). main.js holds
# a single-instance lock, so whichever starts FIRST wins the URL and the second
# launch silently focuses the existing window — after a login, clicking the
# shortcut got Nick the kiosk and no indication why.
#
# Two launchers, one window, and the loser fails quietly. So this script now
# starts only what has no other way of starting: the backend that serves :3005
# and answers /api/presence, and the Watch reporter that feeds it. Opening SARA
# is a thing Nick does deliberately, from `sara/desktop-electron/SARA.vbs` —
# which takes the URL as an argument and needs no console to set it.
#
# If you ever want her up at login again, add a shortcut to SARA.vbs in the
# Startup folder rather than putting Electron back here: that way there is still
# exactly one thing that decides which SARA opens.
