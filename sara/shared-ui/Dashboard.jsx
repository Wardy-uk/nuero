// The dashboard — what SARA is showing, beneath what she said.
//
// ⚠ ONE renderer for every kind. `dashboard.kind` is carried for styling and
// for anything that wants to know, but nothing here switches on it: a renderer
// that knows the kinds is a renderer that has to be edited every time a
// dashboard is added, which is how the two apps drifted in the first place. The
// SHAPE is uniform — label, rows, an optional figure, a note, gaps — and the
// server decides what goes in it (`backend/services/sara-surface.js`).
//
// It fetches nothing, ranks nothing and phrases nothing. Every string here
// arrived composed.
//
// ── The rules it holds ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   * AN EMPTY DASHBOARD IS NEVER SILENT. If there are no rows there is a note
//     saying why — "you're in something", "I couldn't read your diary",
//     "don't read this as an all-clear". A blank panel and a broken one look
//     identical, and only one of them is good news.
//   * GAPS ARE NAMED, NEVER COUNTED. "I couldn't read 2" tells Nick a number
//     instead of a fact, in the most prominent position on the screen.
//   * AN ASSUMED FIGURE SAYS SO. `ofLabel` carries "30 assumed" rather than
//     "30 planned" when nobody ever said how long — laundering the one into the
//     other is exactly what the estimate rules forbid.
