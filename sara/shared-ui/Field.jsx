// Field — SARA's presence on the phone.
//
// She is not an object. There is no orb, no avatar, no face, no glyph, no
// single bright point you could call "where SARA is" — `MANIFESTATION.md`
// deprecates every one of those permanently, and it is right to. What you see
// is Nick's vault as a PINNED, noisy substrate, and SARA visible only as
// ENTROPY FALLING: a region's jitter collapsing, its latent edges firming up,
// then relaxing back to noise. Nothing moves. Nothing is drawn that was not
// already there.
//
// ── The thing that stops this being a screensaver ───────────────────────────
// THE COHERENCE ON SCREEN IS THE COHERENCE OF THE READ. The field is driven by
// the brain's own state, so it is informative before a word is read:
//
//   * can't see your work  → no coherence at all. Pure noise. If NEURO's queue
//                            is unreachable the screen LOOKS unresolved, which
//                            is the honest thing for it to look like.
//   * low confidence       → it barely settles. She is genuinely unsure and the
//                            picture says so.
//   * high confidence      → a clean, complete settle.
//   * quiet (in a meeting) → near-still, but STILL THERE. Staying out of the
//                            way is a visual fact, not a disappearance — she
//                            settles rarely rather than fading out.
//   * firefighting         → settles more often. Something is actually going on.
//
// That mapping is why this survives the "no decorative oscillation" rule: it
// never animates for the look of it. If the state is flat, so is the field.
//
// ── Battery ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// builds ~265 nodes and ~1,100 edges; the 720x1280 kiosk panel hits the 900-node
// ceiling and builds ~10,000 — the clustering concentrates 50 nodes into each
// seed blob, so the edge count runs about 3x what an even scatter of the same
// nodes would give. On a Pi 4 that was a renderer pegged at 100% indefinitely.
//
// The thin is UNIFORM (a shuffle, then a truncate), so the mesh gets sparser

// being in a meeting made her nearly invisible rather than merely calm. She is
// still there in a meeting; she is just not resolving anything. Raising the
// FLOOR (she is always visible) while leaving the SETTLE to carry the state

// to claim things it has not read.

// screensaver this component was written to avoid.
//
// It BRIGHTENS and never darkens (the multiplier runs 1 → 1+amp, never below
// 1). Dipping below the resting level would make her LESS visible at the moment
// something needs him, which is backwards.

// is the obvious way to do this and it lifts the RESTING alpha by 25% — and at
// rest is where nearly every edge sits, so it would have quietly brightened the
// whole substrate. Those rest values are hand-tuned (`EDGE_REST_ALPHA` went
// 0.012 -> 0.03 on 31 Aug to make her more visible); a perf change is not
