// What the SHELL's background field is driven by.
//
// ⚠ WHY THIS EXISTS. Until now the Field only received the live payload on the
// Surface. On the other twelve screens it was hardcoded to `quiet` + `low`, so
// she looked identical whether the queue was on fire or the day was empty — and
// when the slow pulse arrived it could not fire there either, which meant a
// critical item never reached him unless he happened to be looking at her own
// screen. That is the opposite of an ambient surface.
//
// ⚠ It reads ONLY what the field needs, and decides nothing. `activity`,
// `confidence` and `quiet` are the brain's; `pressing` uses the same
// critical-or-high rule `AttentionSurface` applies, imported rather than
// re-stated so the two cannot disagree about what pressing means.
//
// ── Why a second poll is acceptable here ────────────────────────────────────
// The Surface polls the same endpoint every 60s for the FULL payload, with its
// own error handling and its own "keep the last good read on screen" rule; this
// wants four booleans and must never interfere with that. Sharing one fetch
// would mean lifting the Surface's whole state into the shell, which couples
// the ambient background to the screen that happens to be mounted. So it polls
// separately and SLOWLY — the background does not need to be a minute fresh —
// and it is skipped entirely while the Surface is mounted, because that screen
// already has a live read and mounts its own field from it.
