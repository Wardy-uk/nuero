// SAiM shared UI-state — the EMPTY presentation, used before /api/state answers.
//
// ⚠ This file used to hold invented content: two SLA breaches, "Willem's probation
// review is tomorrow", "Nathan has gone quiet", a 13:30 1-2-1 with Adele. It was
// described as a harmless placeholder seam, and in a running app it is not: any
// screen rendering it while the backend is unreachable shows Nick a plausible,
// specific, entirely fictional day — including a performance concern about a named
// colleague. That is the single worst thing SAiM can put on a screen.
//
// So the shared fallback is now EMPTY, and it says so. The backend's own
// `presentation` block (state/provenance.js + stateEngine.buildPresentation) is the
// only thing that ever fills it, and that block is stamped with where every part of it
// came from — `neuro`, `neuro-stale`, `unavailable` or `demo`.
//
// Quick Actions and the capture shortcuts survive, because they are not data about
// Nick: they are buttons that do real things in this app, and Capture in particular
// must stay reachable when the brain is down.
