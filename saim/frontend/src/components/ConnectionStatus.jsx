// The connection banner — the one place SAiM says where what you are looking at came
// from.
//
// It exists because the failure it guards against is invisible by construction: a SAiM
// showing seeded or stale data looks EXACTLY like a SAiM that is working. There was no
// way, from the screen, to tell "two tickets are breaching" from "SAiM has no idea and
// filled it in". Every word here comes from the backend's `provenance` block, so the
// banner cannot drift from the data it describes.
//
// Design rules:
//   * Live is SILENT. A permanent green badge is a badge nobody reads by week two, and
//     the whole point is that the abnormal states stand out.
//   * Demo is the loudest thing on the screen. It is the only state where the content
//     is fiction, and it must be impossible to mistake for a working day.
//   * Every non-live state says what SAiM cannot see, never a reassuring summary.
