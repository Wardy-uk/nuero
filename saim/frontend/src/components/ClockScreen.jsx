// ⚠ NOT A LOCK, AND IT MUST NOT LOOK LIKE ONE. There is nothing to unlock and
// nothing to tap — the moment he walks back in, SAiM returns on her own. A
// padlock or a "tap to continue" would teach him this screen needs dealing
// with, when the whole point is that it does not.
//
// It shows the time and nothing else. Anything more is content displayed to an
// empty room, which is what the state exists to avoid; a countdown or a status
// line would just be SAiM talking to nobody.
//
// On burn-in: the panel has a real 0-31 backlight and an OLED has none, so it
// is an IPS LCD and does not burn in — at worst temporary image persistence.
// The clock can sit still. (The `locked` state blanks the backlight outright,
// which is the display agent's job, not this component's.)
