// LockScreen — privacy lock overlay for the Pi wall display (WS2-WP3).
//
// SAiM runs on an always-on touchscreen with no login, so "lock" here is a PRIVACY
// screen, not authentication: it hides the dashboard when Nick is out of the house, so
// nothing exposes his queue, people notes or calendar. It covers everything (above the
// Exit button) so nothing leaks behind it.
//
// ⚠ THERE IS NOTHING TO TAP, AND IT MUST NOT PRETEND OTHERWISE. It used to say "tap to
// unlock" and mean it — unlock was manual — so Nick came home from an evening out to a
// locked screen that had to be touched before SAiM came back. It now clears itself the
// moment NEURO says he is home, so an affordance inviting a tap would teach him this
// screen needs dealing with when it does not.
//
// In practice he rarely sees this at all: the display agent takes the backlight to 0 in
// the same state, so the panel is genuinely off. This is what is behind it when the light
// returns a moment before the verdict does, and the belt-and-braces if that agent dies.
// Keyed on the reasons NEURO actually sends. An unrecognised one falls back to
// the bare word rather than rendering a stale explanation for a new state.
const REASON_TEXT = {
  'not-home': 'Away from home',
  // Settled in the bedroom for half an hour. Saying "Away from home" here would
  // be plainly wrong to anyone who walked past it, and the two locks are worth
  // telling apart on the rare occasion someone is looking at the thing.

      {/* ⚠ This replaces a pulsing ORB, which `MANIFESTATION.md` deprecates
          permanently: SAiM is not an object and has no single bright point you
          could call "where she is". The field is what she looks like everywhere
          else, and the lock screen is a place Nick SEES her — so it is the
          field here too, degraded, because in this state she genuinely cannot
          see anything.

          ⚠ STILL. This state takes the backlight to 0, so there is nobody to
          animate for — and a browser cannot tell a dark panel from a lit one
          (`document.hidden` is never set on a kiosk), so the field's own battery
          guard never fires here. It painted at 12fps into an unlit screen for as
          long as Nick was out. One static frame keeps her present for the case
          this component exists for — the light returning before the verdict
          does, or the display agent dying — and costs nothing while it does
          not. */}
