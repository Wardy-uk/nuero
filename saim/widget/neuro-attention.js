// NEURO — Attention widget for Scriptable (iOS)
//
// The third renderer of GET /api/attention, after saim/app's Surface and the
// kiosk. It renders what the brain decided; it decides nothing itself.
//
// ── The three silences must stay distinguishable ────────────────────────────
// A blank card is not one state, it is four, and conflating them is how a
// broken feed comes to look like a good day:
//   • unreachable    — "I couldn't ask" (Pi down, no Tailscale, bad token)
//   • pool unavailable — "I can't see your work; this is NOT an all-clear"
//   • quiet          — in a meeting, off, away: nothing SHOULD be said
//   • nothing pending — we looked, and there genuinely is nothing
// Each gets its own words. None of them renders as an empty box.
//
// ── What this file deliberately does not do ─────────────────────────────────
// No re-ranking, no rephrasing, no working out where a card should go. `say`,
// `speech` and `tab` are all composed server-side so the widget, the app and
// the notification for one thing cannot say it three ways or route it two.
//
// ── Setup ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// 1. Install Scriptable, paste this in as a script named "NEURO".
// 2. Run it once inside the app — it prompts for the base URL and API token
//    and stores both in the iOS Keychain.
// 3. Long-press the home screen → add a Scriptable widget → pick "NEURO".
//    Medium or large. Small shows the primary card only.
// 4. To SWIPE between work and personal: add a SECOND NEURO widget, drag it on
//    top of the first to make a stack, and set the second one's Parameter to
//    `flip` (long-press, Edit Widget, Parameter). Leave the first blank.
//    The top card then follows the context and one swipe shows the other side.
//    iOS provides the swipe — a widget cannot detect a gesture itself.
//
// ⚠ THIS FILE MUST CONTAIN NO BACKSLASHES — none, anywhere, including inside
// regex literals and string escapes. It reaches the phone by being COPIED and
// PASTED through Safari, and a backslash does not reliably survive that trip:
// an escaped forward slash inside a regex literal arrived as a syntax error on
// Nick's phone and the whole widget refused to parse. That rule covers COMMENTS
// too — this one used to quote the offending pattern, and tripped its own test.
// Use String.fromCharCode() for control characters,
// split/join instead of regex replace, and endsWith/slice instead of anchors.
// A test pins this so it cannot creep back in.
//
// The token is NEVER written into this file: the repo is public, and a
// credential in a tracked file is exactly how the PIN leaked in July.
// To change it later: run the script in-app and hold the Cancel-free prompt,
// or delete the keys via Scriptable's own console.

/**
 * Which view this instance shows.
 *
 * ⚠ iOS widgets cannot be swiped internally — WidgetKit renders a still, and
 * there is no gesture inside it. What CAN be swiped is a SMART STACK: several
 * widgets in one slot, swiped between by the system. So "swipeable" is two
 * instances of this script in a stack, each pinned to a side of the split, and
 * Scriptable tells them apart by the per-instance widget parameter.
 *
 *   (empty)   follow the brain — work in hours, personal outside them
 *   flip      always the OTHER side of whatever the brain just decided
 *   work      always the working view
 *   personal  always his own
 *
 * `flip` is what makes a stack behave the way Nick asked for: the top card
 * follows the context, the one beneath is always the other half. iOS provides
 * the swipe — a widget cannot detect a gesture itself, in any app.
 *
 * Set it by long-pressing the widget, Edit Widget, Parameter.
 *
 * Anything unrecognised falls back to `auto` rather than erroring: a typo in a
 * text field should cost the pin, not the widget.

 *
 * A widget cannot animate, so it renders ONE FRAME — and that is not a
 * compromise, because the app's own rule is that THE COHERENCE ON SCREEN IS THE
 * COHERENCE OF THE READ. A still frame carries that perfectly:
 *
 *   pool unreadable → no coherence at all; pure noise, no edges
 *   low confidence  → barely settled, edges faint
 *   high confidence → a clean, connected mesh
 *   quiet           → the same picture, dimmed right back
 *
 * So the background is informative before a word of it is read, and it is never
 * decoration: with nothing to say, there is nothing to see.
 *
 * Density, edge distance, clustering and colours are taken from Field.jsx
 * deliberately, so the widget and the phone are visibly the same entity.
