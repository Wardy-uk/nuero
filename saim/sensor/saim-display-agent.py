"""SAiM display agent - the backlight half of the three states.

Runs on the Pi that HAS the screen (pi-dev). The browser renders `full` and
`clock`; only this can do `locked`, because a page cannot write
/sys/class/backlight - and painting the screen black is not the same thing:
an LCD showing black still glows, still burns power, and still lights a dark
room. Backlight to 0 is genuinely off.

⚠ ON BURN-IN, since it is the obvious worry with a clock on screen all day:
this panel has a real backlight with a 0-31 range, and an OLED has no backlight
at all - so it is an IPS LCD, which does not burn in the way an OLED does. At
worst it gets temporary image persistence. The clock does not need to move.
The backlight is used because it is honest and saves power, not to protect the
panel.

⚠ IT FAILS TOWARDS LIGHT. Every error path - unreachable backend, bad JSON,
a state it does not recognise - restores the backlight. A bug here that fails
dark leaves Nick tapping at a screen that looks broken, with no way to tell
that from a dead Pi; a bug that fails bright is merely a screen that stayed on.
That asymmetry decides every branch below.

The brightness to restore TO is whatever was set at startup, not a hardcoded
number: Nick may have dimmed the panel to suit the room, and a display agent
that resets his brightness every time he walks past is its own small annoyance.
