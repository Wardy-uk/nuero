"""SAiM room sensor - one Pi, one room, passive Apple Watch BLE proximity.

Replaces the single-threshold `watch-presence-service.py`. Three things changed,
each of them a bug that actually bit (31 Aug 2026):

1. A SCAN THAT HEARS NOTHING IS `unknown`, NEVER `away`.
   The old service reported `away` every few seconds for FIFTEEN DAYS from a
   scan that had silently stopped delivering, and nothing noticed - a dead
   sensor and an empty room read identically. So the health signal is the
   background: `backgroundAdverts` counts EVERY device, not just the watch. A
   household has two dozen BLE devices chattering; zero of them means the radio
   is deaf, not that the house is empty. This is `ambient.standStillness` using
   heartRate to tell "sitting" from "watch on charge", one floor down.

2. PRESENCE IS RATE OVER A WINDOW, NOT A PER-SAMPLE THRESHOLD.
   Measured at Nick's usual seat, 2m from the Pi: RSSI spans -84..-43, a 26 dB
   spread WITHOUT MOVING, and adverts arrive with gaps of up to 3.8s. The old
   rule marked each 0.5s slot near/far against one threshold and counted a slot
   with no advert as "far" - so a single silent gap manufactured seven "far"
   samples and the state flapped present/away every few seconds while he sat
   still. No threshold can fix that rule; the rule is what is wrong. A rate and
   a median over a 20s window are stable against both the spread and the gaps.

3. THE ADAPTER GETS STUCK, SO THE SENSOR RESETS IT - AND A HANG COUNTS AS STUCK.
   BlueZ can end up refusing every new scan with `InProgress` while reporting
   `Discovering: no` - a phantom scan that survives the client dying AND an
   `hciconfig down/up`. Worse, and seen on pi5 at 49 days uptime: `start()` does
   not always raise, it simply NEVER RETURNS. systemd then reports the unit
   `active`, the log stops after one line, and nothing is wrong anywhere you
   would look. So the start is bounded by a timeout - an unbounded await is the
   same silent death in a new costume - and recovery ESCALATES: cycle the
   adapter first, restart bluetoothd if that was not enough.

The IRK is read from the environment, which systemd fills from a ROOT-ONLY
EnvironmentFile. Never pass it on a command line: argv is world-readable through
/proc, so `sudo env WATCH_IRK=... python ...` leaks the key to every user.

Reports are PUSHED. A pull would make an unreachable Pi look exactly like an
absent watch, which is the whole failure above wearing a different hat; pushed,
silence ages into staleness and the consumer can see it.

# Passive scanning, for the Pi 3B+ only.
#
# ⚠ WHY IT EXISTS: the Pi 3B+ runs WiFi and Bluetooth through ONE combo chip on
# ONE antenna. Measured 31 Aug 2026: with Bluetooth up it dropped to 4/8 pings;
# with Bluetooth down, 10/10. The Pi 4 and Pi 5 have far better coexistence and
# are unaffected, so this is opt-in per sensor rather than the default.
#
# An ACTIVE scan transmits a scan request for every advert it hears, and on a
# shared antenna that transmission is what wrecks the WiFi. Passive is
# receive-only. We lose scan-response data and never used it: the IRK is
# resolved from the advertising ADDRESS, and RSSI comes with the advert.
#
# ⚠ BlueZ passive scanning requires `--experimental` AND at least one
# advertisement-data pattern - bleak will not start a passive scan with an empty
# filter. So the patterns below must be broad enough to keep hearing the
# BACKGROUND, not just the watch: the background is the health signal that tells
# a deaf radio from an empty room, and narrowing it to Apple would quietly
# destroy that check while appearing to work.

# ⚠ PER SENSOR, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. The first design compared rooms by
# RSSI and picked the loudest, which silently compared a Pi 4's radio with a Pi
# 5's THROUGH NICK'S BODY: measured 31 Aug 2026, sat still in the living room
# with the watch on the arm shielded from the Pi 4 and a clear line to the Pi 5,
# the KITCHEN read 9 dB stronger and took the room. A body attenuates 2.4 GHz by
# 5-15 dB and a plasterboard wall by 3-5, so his own arm outweighed a wall.
# Nothing here compares rooms; each sensor answers only about its own.
#
# ⚠ THE TEST IS RSSI, AND RATE WAS TRIED FIRST AND WAS WRONG. On four samples
# rate looked like a clean 4x separation; over a real hour of Nick moving around
# the house it was not:
#   living-room rate, him UPSTAIRS    0.4 0.8 0.9 1.05 1.25 1.55 1.65 1.9
#   living-room rate, him DOWNSTAIRS  2.2 2.25 2.35 2.45 2.65
# 1.9 against 2.2 is not a gap, and the screen flapped four times across it.
#
# ⚠ WORSE, IN PASSIVE MODE RATE IS INVERTED. The bedroom sensor:
#   watch IN the bedroom   -51/0.08  -53/0.03  -58/0.05  -62/0.03
#   watch downstairs       -80/0.25  -85/0.25  -86/0.48  -71/0.35
# Nearer gives FEWER callbacks, because AdvertisementMonitor reports found/lost
# churn rather than advert volume: a marginal device flaps and generates events,
# a strong one is found once and goes quiet. Rate there is not weak, it is
# backwards.
#
# RSSI within ONE sensor separates cleanly, which is the distinction that
# matters - it is only comparison BETWEEN sensors that is invalid (different
# radios, and a body in the way):
#   living-room sensor  downstairs -62..-74   upstairs -84..-88   (10 dB)
#   bedroom sensor      upstairs   -51..-65   downstairs -80..-86 (15 dB)
