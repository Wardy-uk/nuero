// ── The page itself comes from the NETWORK first ─────────────────────────────
//
// ⚠ REGISTERED BEFORE `precacheAndRoute`, and the order is the whole mechanism.
// Workbox matches routes in registration order, and the precache registers a
// route for `/` and `/index.html` — so with precache first, a reload was served
// the PREVIOUS build's HTML, which references the previous build's asset
// hashes, which are also precached. The page therefore loaded entirely from
// yesterday while the new worker installed quietly behind it, and only the
// SECOND reload showed the new build.
//
// That is not a theoretical ordering nicety. It cost three screenshots of the
// Pi panel showing a UI from before 30 August over a correctly-updated server,
// and then cost Nick a refresh that came back on build 540a138 while the width
// change he had just asked for was sitting in 165340a. `skipWaiting` and
// `clients.claim` below do NOT fix this: they make the new worker take over
// fast, but the page in front of him was already built from the old HTML.
//
// A screen that shows last week's app and looks completely fine is the failure
// this codebase refuses everywhere else. Here the CACHE was introducing it.
//
// ⚠ The offline promise is kept, and it matters on a phone — the capture
// outbox, opening her on a train. NetworkFirst falls back to its own cache, so
// a genuine outage still gets the last good shell; the 3s timeout bounds how
// long a bad connection can hold the launch. Hashed assets stay PRECACHED
// below, because they are immutable and are the bulk of the offline story.

// A swiped-away iOS PWA doesn't reliably count as closed, so the phone kept serving the
// previous bundle after a deploy: voice arrived one build late, the voice picker didn't
// arrive at all, and "fully close and reopen" was never a dependable fix.
