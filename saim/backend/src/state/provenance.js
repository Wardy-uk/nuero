// Provenance — where every number on a SAiM screen actually came from.
//
// This module exists because of one failure: the State Engine used to fall back to
// `seed.js` whenever NEURO was unreachable. Seeded content is not neutral filler — it
// names real colleagues, invents SLA breaches and puts a probation review in Nick's
// day that does not exist. A kiosk showing that during an outage looks exactly like a
// kiosk that is working, which is the worst of both: SAiM is wrong AND confident.
//
// So there are now four, and only four, provenances a domain may carry, and every
// consumer must be able to tell them apart:
//
//   live        — read from NEURO just now.
//   stale       — read from NEURO a while ago; NEURO is not answering right now.
//   unavailable — we could not read it. NOT "there is nothing there".
//   demo        — invented. Only reachable behind SAIM_DEMO_MODE, never in production.
//
// The domain builders below are the `unavailable` renderings. They are contract-shaped
// (so the model still validates and no screen crashes) and structurally EMPTY (so no
// screen can read a fact out of them), and each carries a sentence saying what SAiM
// could not see. Empty-because-unread must never be mistaken for empty-because-clear.
//
// CommonJS only.

  // deliberate product removal, not an outage. Reported as `unavailable` it
  // rolled the whole model up to `mixed`, so the kiosk banner read "Partly
  // live — some of NEURO could not be read" PERMANENTLY, seven weeks and
  // counting, over three domains that were all perfectly live.
  //
  // A warning that is always on is a warning nobody reads, and it costs the
  // real one: by week two "partly live" carries no information at all. Same
  // species as the stale Jira cache that reported a 3 July snapshot as current
  // fact — a reader outliving its writer — one level up in the UI.
