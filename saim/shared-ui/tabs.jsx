// The screen set — ONE list, rendered by the phone AND the Pi kiosk.
//
// ⚠ WHY IT MOVED HERE. Nick, 31 Aug 2026: "make the Pi version of SAiM the same
// as the phone app — same for the desktop." Until now the kiosk had its own
// fourteen-screen registry (`saim/frontend/src/state/views.js`) over
// `saim/backend`'s state model, while the phone had these thirteen over NEURO.
// Two screen sets, two vocabularies, two ideas of what SAiM is — the drift that
// `AttentionSurface` and `voiceUtils` each had to be un-drifted from, one level
// up. There is one list now and both shells mount it.
//
// The COMPONENTS are the phone's, deliberately: they are the ones written
// against NEURO's own contracts. The kiosk reaches those contracts through
// `saim/backend`'s allowlisted proxy (`routes/neuroProxy.js`) rather than by
// holding a credential in an always-on desk browser — sharing the screens never
// required sharing where the credential lives.
//
// ── The three primary modes ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//   Capture — get it out of his head immediately, online or off
//   Now     — one current action and the next transition, sourced and stamped
//   Review  — morning orientation, shutdown, weekly reset
//
// ⚠ Everything else is SECONDARY, not deleted — including the SAiM Surface,
// which is what notification routing lands on and is one tap away. "A thing he
// cannot find is worse than a menu he does not need" (25 Aug) is unchanged.
//
// ⚠ Every id here must also exist in `SAIM_LITE_TABS` in
// `shared/action-surfaces.cjs`, or a notification routed to it falls back to
// Focus in silence. `action-surfaces.test.js` reads this file and fails if not.
